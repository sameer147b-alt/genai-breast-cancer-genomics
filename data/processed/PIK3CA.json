  "llm_context": "Gene: PIK3CA\nProtein name: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform\nUniProt ID: P32871\nBiological function:\nPhosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at position 3 of the inositol ring to produce 3-phosphoinositides (PubMed:1322797, PubMed:14729945). Uses ATP and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (By similarity). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Participates in cellular signaling in response to various growth factors. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases ligands such as EGF, insulin, IGF1, VEGFA and PDGF. Involved in signaling via insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Essential in endothelial cell migration during vascular development through VEGFA signaling, possibly by regulating RhoA activity. Required for lymphatic vasculature development, possibly by binding to RAS and by activation by EGF and FGF2, but not by PDGF. Regulates invadopodia formation through the PDPK1-AKT1 pathway. Participates in cardiomyogenesis in embryonic stem cells through a AKT1 pathway. Participates in vasculogenesis in embryonic stem cells through PDK1 and protein kinase C pathway (By similarity). In addition to its lipid kinase activity, it displays a serine-protein kinase activity that results in the autophosphorylation of the p85alpha regulatory subunit as well as phosphorylation of other proteins such as 4EBP1, H-Ras, the IL-3 beta c receptor and possibly others (PubMed:14729945, PubMed:15178440). Plays a role in the positive regulation of phagocytosis and pinocytosis (By similarity)\nRelevant breast cancer literature:\nTitle: CRISPR-Based Single-Nucleotide Editing of <i>PIK3CA</i> c.3140A>G (p.His1047Arg) in MCF7 Breast Cancer Cells Enhances Proliferative Potential.\nJournal: Cell journal (2025)\nAbstract: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of many cancers. The PIK3CA gene, which encodes the alpha catalytic subunit of PI3K, is altered in approximately 30% of breast cancers. Among its mutations, c.3140A>G (p.His1047Arg) in the kinase domain is the most prevalent, producing a constitutively active enzyme with oncogenic potential. Here, we engineered a population of MCF7 cells carrying the <i>PIK3CA</i> c.3140A>G mutation using CRISPR-Cas9 with precise single-nucleotide editing, and evaluated its impact on cellular characteristics. In this experimental study, nearly homogeneous populations of <i>PIK3CA</i> H1047R mutant MCF7 cells were generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing followed by hierarchical single-cell isolation. Editing efficiency was validated through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiple rounds of Sanger sequencing. Cell cycle distribution and proliferation were analyzed using flow cytometry and cell count assays, respectively. Gene expression changes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the mutation's impact on cell cycle-related genes. Tracking of insertions, deletions, and recombination events (TIDER) analysis showed approximately 60% homology-directed repair (HDR) efficiency in the edited population. Flow cytometry revealed a 5% increase in the G2/M cell population in the edited clone compared with unedited controls (P<0.001). Proliferation assays demonstrated significantly accelerated growth (1.30 fold) under low fetal bovine serum (FBS) conditions (P=0.029). Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed upregulation of cell cycle-promoting genes, with <i>CCND1</i> and MYC expression increasing by 1.62-fold (P<0.001) and 1.23-fold (P<0.001), respectively, relative to controls. The genetically edited cell lines represent robust and well-defined experimental models that enable direct assessment of the functional consequences of oncogenic driver mutations on cellular behavior and signaling pathways. Our findings demonstrate that targeted genetic alterations induce measurable changes in proliferation, cell-cycle regulation, and gene expression, thereby providing mechanistic insight into tumorigenesis and the specific contribution of driver mutations to cancer-related cellular phenotypes.\nTitle: Comparison Between Alpelisib Plus Endocrine Therapy and Everolimus Plus Endocrine Therapy After CDK4/6 Inhibitors Progression in Patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-Mutant Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.\nJournal: Cancers (2026)\nAbstract: <b>Background</b>: Evidence on the efficacy of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant after progression on CKD4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) is derived from a single non-comparative prospective study. Conversely, the effectiveness of everolimus plus exemestane on <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant metastatic breast cancer (BC) after CDK4/6i failure has never been investigated in a prospective study. In this retrospective study, we compared alpelisib plus endocrine therapy (ET) with everolimus plus exemestane in patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant metastatic BC post-CDK4/6i progression. <b>Methods</b>: We tracked 40 patients treated with alpelisib plus ET and 22 treated with everolimus plus exemestane. We further identified 42 patients who did not harbor <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (<i>PIK3CA</i>-wild-type group) and received everolimus as a subsequent treatment after progression on CDK4/6i. The timeframe spanned from 1st March 2020 to 30th November 2024. <b>Results</b>: The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the alpelisib group was 4.9 months compared to 4.5 months for the everolimus group [Hazard ratio (HR), 1.22; 95% CI, 0.65-2.28; <i>p</i>-value = 0.53]. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.6 months and 18.3 months for alpelisib and everolimus, respectively (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.25-1.76; <i>p</i>-value = 0.47). Median PFS in the <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant everolimus plus ET group was 4.5 months (95% CI, 2.8-6.7) compared to 5 months (95% CI, 3.5-6.9) for the <i>PIK3CA</i>-wild-type everolimus plus ET group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46-1.29; <i>p</i>-value = 0.32). The most common side effects in the alpelisib group were hyperglycemia (57.5%), rash (27.5%), and anorexia (22.5%), while the most common side effects in the everolimus group were fatigue (40.9%) and stomatitis (27.3%). <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results regarding the efficacy of alpelisib plus ET were inferior to those reported in the current literature. Conversely, outcomes of everolimus plus exemestane were consistent with the current literature, denoting that the combination is an acceptable treatment option for patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant metastatic BC.\nTitle: Detection of Cancer-Associated Mutations Using Primer Exchange Reaction-Based Signal Amplification and Lateral Flow Assays.\nJournal: Small science (2026)\nAbstract: The ability to sensitively and specifically detect cancer-associated nucleic acids carrying single-nucleotide mutations is critical for early cancer detection, patient stratification, and personalized treatment, particularly through non-invasive liquid biopsy approaches. Detecting low-abundance nucleic acid fragments-particularly those with single-nucleotide variations-remains a significant challenge for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. Here, we report a programmable DNA-based self-assembly strategy that leverages primer exchange reaction (PER) for isothermal signal amplification and enables colorimetric detection of cancer-specific DNA and RNA fragments on gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assays (LFAs). This method uses PER-generated DNA concatemers functionalized with multiple FITC-labeled imager strands to enhance the visual signal on conventional LFA strips. We demonstrate that this approach enables detection of a synthetic <i>P53</i> oncogene fragment with a limit of detection as low as 16\u2009pM, representing a 16-fold improvement over single-dye labeled controls. The system also reliably distinguishes single-nucleotide mutations at 10% relative abundance within a wild-type background. Moreover, we show successful detection of mutant fragments in complex biological fluids such as serum and saliva, as well as of RNA extracted from breast cancer cell lines and RNA derived from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patient plasma samples. Specifically, we detect clinically relevant <i>PIK3CA</i> E545K/A and <i>P53</i> R280K mutations, consistent with Sanger sequencing results and validating our method for liquid biopsy applications. Overall, this PER-based self-assembly system provides a simple, robust, and sensitive platform for mutation-specific nucleic acid detection using LFAs and offers strong potential for translation into laboratory research applications and POC diagnostics workflows for cancer and other genetic disorders.\nTitle: Case Report: Mixed ductal-lobular carcinoma consisting of invasive lobular carcinoma with a glycogen-rich clear cell pattern and elevated tumor mutation burden.\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology (2026)\nAbstract: Mixed ductal-lobular carcinoma (MDL) of the breast exhibits considerable molecular complexity. The pathways leading to the glycogen-rich clear cell morphology of the breast tumors, and its clinical relevance, currently remain unclear. Herein, we report a case of MDL, predominantly composed of invasive lobular carcinoma with a glycogen-rich clear cell pattern (gILC), accompanied by classic invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). A 70-year-old woman presented with a 3.5 cm mass in the left breast, for which total mastectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was MDL predominantly comprising gILC. Tissue samples from the gILC and IDC areas were subjected to whole-exome and RNA sequencing. The gILC region had a higher tumor mutation burden than the IDC. Three stop-gain single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in <i>CDH1</i>, <i>SETD2</i>, and <i>USP9</i> and two nonsynonymous SNVs in <i>PIK3CA</i> were identified in the gILC region, whereas only two nonsynonymous SNVs in <i>SMAD4</i> and <i>PIK3CA</i> were identified in the IDC region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a common ancestor of gILC and IDC, sharing a pathogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> p.H1047L mutation. Reduced SETD2 protein and H3K36me3 levels and the DNA mismatch repair-microsatellite instability-associated mutational signatures SBS6 and SBS26 were uniquely demonstrated in gILC. Further, a structural variant involving <i>HNF1B</i> and elevated <i>HNF1B</i> transcript levels was detected in gILC. The predominant gILC component was estrogen receptor-positive. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was administered postoperatively, and the patient currently remains disease-free at 51 months. In this case, the gILC and IDC components of an MDL shared a common origin, but exhibited marked genomic divergence. This experience also shows that SETD2 functional impairment may underlie gILC hypermutation, while HNF1B overexpression could contributes to a glycogen-rich clear cytoplasm. Overall, this case emphasizes the complexity of MDL with gILC, and highlights the need for further studies to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and their prognostic implications.\nTitle: Genomic and clinicopathological characteristics of low\u00a0oncotype recurrent score breast cancers with subsequent metastasis.\nJournal: Histopathology (2026)\nAbstract: Oncotype DX has played a critical role in guiding treatment decisions for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Clinically, a subset of patients with low Oncotype recurrent score (RS) will still progress on standard therapy and ultimately develop metastasis. Our goal was to explore potential molecular mechanisms, including specific genetic alterations and pathway activity associated with disease progression. We retrospectively reviewed a small series of low RS breast cancers with subsequent metastasis and analysed the clinicopathological characteristics and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) data from tumour tissue and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) by liquid biopsy. These tumours demonstrated a range of histopathologic features and molecular profiles. Common findings included enrichment of PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and treatment-emergent ESR1 mutations, observed in both tissue and ctDNA. CDKN2A, SPEN, KIT, CTNNB1, MYC, EMSY, KMT2C, MAP3K1 gene alterations were only found in low RS group in low frequency. Copy number amplifications events were less common in low RS group. In cases with both tissue and ctDNA data, tissue CGP proved useful baseline for identifying driver mutations such as PIK3CA and for contextualizing ctDNA findings, and ctDNA analysis was adequate for disease monitoring and tracking molecular evolution over time. Using real-world CGP of tumour tissue and ctDNA, we identified key molecular features associated with endocrine resistance in patients with low RS who later developed metastases. PIK3CA mutation and other ER group-related mutations contributed to the low RS. Tissue CGP provides baseline for interpreting ctDNA, and ctDNA monitoring PIK3CA, TP53, ESR1 and other pathogenic or driver mutations in the early course of low RS cases may represent an excellent non-invasive option for identifying targets and early intervention to prevent disease progression, though a large validation study is needed.\nTitle: Optimizing second-line endocrine-based treatment in HR positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer: a comprehensive expert statement from the Gulf Cooperation Council Region.\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology (2025)\nAbstract: Optimizing second-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is challenged by variations in diagnostic capacity, drug accessibility, comorbidities, and treatment pathways compared with other regions. While international guidelines provide an overarching evidence framework for breast cancer management, their practical application at the regional level often requires adaptation to local healthcare resources. There is an unmet need to optimize the treatment sequencing strategies for patients with HR+/HER2-negative mBC in the GCC region through expert guidance. Given this context, a virtual advisory board involving 10 oncologists from the GCC region was convened in November 2024. The panel aimed to review current evidence and develop pragmatic, implementable recommendations for second-line management. This consensus uniquely contextualizes global evidence for GCC-specific healthcare constraints, addressing gaps in diagnostic access, affordability, and real-world feasibility, while providing treatment recommendations that help clinicians refine therapeutic strategies and incorporate patient preferences for improved outcomes. The panel recommends early genomic testing (PIK3CA, AKT, BRCA, ESR1) to guide therapy, prioritizing targeted agents such as oral SERDs and PI3K/AKT inhibitors in second-line sequencing, cautious use of alpelisib in diabetic patients, and incorporating patient preferences through shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care.\nTitle: Comprehensive profiling of somatic alterations and HRD characteristics in Chinese germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer patients.\nJournal: American journal of cancer research (2026)\nAbstract: Approximately 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary and associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. To characterize the somatic alteration landscape and HRD-related genomic features, we analyzed next-generation sequencing and clinical data from 1,243 breast cancer patients treated at Tianjin Cancer Hospital Airport Hospital between October 2021 and November 2024. We compared mutation patterns and clinicopathological features between patients with and without germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutations and further assessed somatic alterations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in those carrying pathogenic variants. PIK3CA mutations were significantly more frequent in the Non-Germline and non-gBRCA groups than in the Germline and gBRCA groups (49% vs. 6%; 47% vs. 0%; both P < 0.001), indicating mutual exclusivity with gBRCA mutations. Conversely, PTEN alterations co-occurred in 30% of gBRCA cases, while TP53 mutations were mutually exclusive with MDM2 and FGFR1. HER2 amplification was identified in 10% of gBRCA-mutated tumors, and somatic alterations in non-gBRCA tumors were enriched in endocrine-resistance pathways. HRD scores were markedly higher in gBRCA patients than in non-gBRCA patients (median 59 vs. 24.5, P = 0.015), driven by significant increases in large-scale state transitions (LST) and telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI). The overall gBRCA1/2 mutation frequency was 15.61%, and two previously unreported variants, BRCA1 NM_007294.3:c.4185G>A and BRCA2 NM_000059.3:c.439C>A, were identified in the Chinese population. These findings provide a biological rationale to explore AKT1/HER2-targeted combinations with PARP inhibition in future studies for gBRCA-mutated breast cancer and provide the first evidence of PIK3CA-gBRCA mutual exclusivity in Chinese patients. The elevated HRD scores further underscore the presence of homologous recombination deficiency in the gBRCA group.\nTitle: Exploring the spectrum of HER2 in non-metastatic triple negative breast cancer: from HER2-Null to HER2-low, including HER2-ultralow status.\nJournal: Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology (2026)\nAbstract: HER2-low and -ultralow breast cancer have recently emerged as distinct theranostic subcategories within the HER2 spectrum, prompting reassessment of traditional HER2-negative immunohistochemistry scores (0, 1+\u2009, and 2+\u2009without amplification). This study reclassifies, according to this new categorization, a cohort of 367 patients who have never received chemotherapy and have non-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We evaluated its association with their clinicopathological features and prognosis. HER2 0 tumors were reclassified as HER2-null (no staining) or HER2-ultralow (\u226410% faint, incomplete membrane staining). HER2 1+\u2009or 2+\u2009(non-amplified) tumors were defined as HER2-low. Overall, 38.4%, 37.6% and 24.0% of TNBC samples were reclassified as HER2-null, -ultralow and -low, respectively. HER2-ultralow tumors were more frequently associated with the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (p\u2009=\u20090.0259) and BRCA1 promoter methylation (p\u2009=\u20090.0439) than HER2-low tumors. Moreover, compared with HER2-null samples, HER2-ultralow tumors were of smaller size (p\u2009=\u20090.0167) and lower stage and grade (p\u2009=\u20090.0066 and p\u2009=\u20090.0364, respectively). Conversely, age, lymph node involvement, histology, molecular apocrine or basal-like phenotypes, PIK3CA and PTEN status, immune infiltrates, assessed using T-cell (CD3), B-cell (CD20) and macrophage (CD163) markers, and PD-L1 expression in tumor or stromal cells were not associated with the HER2-ultralow status. The survival analysis (median follow-up\u2009=\u200910.3\u00a0years) showed that relapse-free survival was not influenced by the HER2 status. Despite some significantly different clinicopathological features, there is no solid evidence to support HER2-ultralow, HER2-low and HER2-null cancers as individual TNBC clinical-molecular entities. Particularly, assigning TNBC samples to the HER2-null, -ultralow and -low categories did not bring any additional prognostic value.\nTitle: Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor with a novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation (c.1624G>A) unresponsive to alpelisib: A case report.\nJournal: Respiratory medicine case reports (2026)\nAbstract: Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFMT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor of uncertain origin, and the biological course of common OFMTs is indolent. Gene fusion constitutes an important pathogenic event in the development of OFMT, and recurrent PHF1 gene rearrangements are detected in up to 80\u00a0% of OFMTs. Here, we report a case of a 35-year-old man with elbow OFMT that recurred and metastasized to lung. Comprehensive genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of recurrence identified a rare mutation in <i>PIK3CA</i>. Based on the findings, the patient opted for off-label therapy with alpelisib, an \u03b1-specific PI3K inhibitor that selectively targets p110\u03b1 and has shown promising efficacy in breast cancer patients harboring the identical <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations. However, no clinical response was observed in the patient, and the lack of response may be associated with the specific nature of the <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation, and/or other unfavorable tumor biological factors that override any benefit from alpelisib.\nTitle: Prognostic and monitoring value of circulating tumor DNA at multiple clinical time points in breast cancer.\nJournal: Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan) (2026)\nAbstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer, potentially offering a more comprehensive representation of tumor genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we assessed the prognostic and monitoring values of ctDNA at multiple clinical time points during diagnosis and therapy. A total of 119 patients with breast cancer underwent ctDNA analysis using next-generation sequencing, targeting 47 breast cancer-related genes at three predefined time points (baseline, post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy [post-NAC], and follow-up). Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed based on ctDNA status. ctDNA was detected in 50.9% of patients at baseline, 25.0% post-NAC, and 58.3% during follow-up. ctDNA positivity was associated with worse DFS at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 7.54, 95% CI: 1.71-33.17, P\u2009=\u20090.008), post-NAC (HR 3.54, 95% CI: 1.24-10.12, P\u2009=\u20090.018), and follow-up (HR 7.68, 95% CI: 0.98-59.97, P\u2009=\u20090.052). TP53 mutations were the most frequently observed, present in 37.5%, 14.8%, and 20.4% of patients at baseline, post-NAC, and follow-up, respectively. PIK3CA mutations were the second most common, detected in 11.6%, 4.5%, and 5.8% of patients, respectively. ctDNA positivity for these mutations consistently showed elevated HRs for disease progression across clinical time points (HR range, 2.73-20.49). ctDNA non-clearance was associated with the highest risk of disease progression (HR 81.09, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and remained the strongest independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 52.07, P\u2009<\u20090.001). ctDNA analysis provides significant clinical utility for prognostic stratification and disease monitoring in breast cancer management."
