  "llm_context": "Gene: BRCA1\nProtein name: Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein\nUniProt ID: P38398\nBiological function:\nE3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage (PubMed:10500182, PubMed:12887909, PubMed:12890688, PubMed:14976165, PubMed:16818604, PubMed:17525340, PubMed:19261748). It is unclear whether it also mediates the formation of other types of polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:12890688). The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability (PubMed:12890688, PubMed:14976165, PubMed:20351172). Regulates centrosomal microtubule nucleation (PubMed:18056443). Required for appropriate cell cycle arrests after ionizing irradiation in both the S-phase and the G2 phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:10724175, PubMed:11836499, PubMed:12183412, PubMed:19261748). Required for FANCD2 targeting to sites of DNA damage (PubMed:12887909). Inhibits lipid synthesis by binding to inactive phosphorylated ACACA and preventing its dephosphorylation (PubMed:16326698). Contributes to homologous recombination repair (HRR) via its direct interaction with PALB2, fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks (PubMed:19369211). Component of the BRCA1-RBBP8 complex which regulates CHEK1 activation and controls cell cycle G2/M checkpoints on DNA damage via BRCA1-mediated ubiquitination of RBBP8 (PubMed:16818604). Acts as a transcriptional activator (PubMed:20160719)\nSubcellular location: Chromosome, Cytoplasm, Nucleus\nDisease relevance:\n- A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue. Breast neoplasms can be distinguished by their histologic pattern. Invasive ductal carcinoma is by far the most common type. Breast cancer is etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Important genetic factors have been indicated by familial occurrence and bilateral involvement. Mutations at more than one locus can be involved in different families or even in the same case.\n- A condition associated with familial predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovaries. Characteristic features in affected families are an early age of onset of breast cancer (often before age 50), increased chance of bilateral cancers (cancer that develop in both breasts, or both ovaries, independently), frequent occurrence of breast cancer among men, increased incidence of tumors of other specific organs, such as the prostate.\n- A form of Fanconi anemia, a disorder affecting all bone marrow elements and resulting in anemia, leukopenia and thrombopenia. It is associated with cardiac, renal and limb malformations, dermal pigmentary changes, and a predisposition to the development of malignancies. At the cellular level it is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, chromosomal instability (increased chromosome breakage) and defective DNA repair.\n- A malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. Tumors can arise from both the exocrine and endocrine portions of the pancreas, but 95% of them develop from the exocrine portion, including the ductal epithelium, acinar cells, connective tissue, and lymphatic tissue.\n- The term ovarian cancer defines malignancies originating from ovarian tissue. Although many histologic types of ovarian tumors have been described, epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common form. Ovarian cancers are often asymptomatic and the recognized signs and symptoms, even of late-stage disease, are vague. Consequently, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease.\nRelevant breast cancer literature:\nTitle: From genetic risk to early detection - clinical outcomes of a person-centered screening program for women with a high genetic risk of breast cancer.\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology (2025)\nAbstract: There is little evidence on breast cancer (BC) diagnosed in women with a high genetic risk, before and after their inclusion in a long-term risk management program based on genetic risk assessment. We analyzed clinical outcomes in women enrolled in the Phare Grand Ouest (PGO) program. The PGO includes carriers of the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> pathogenic variants (PV) and women at high risk without <i>BRCA PV</i>, enrolled in eight cancer genetics units. The study population included all women with incident or prevalent BC, and 1:1 matching by age at first diagnosis was conducted. Multivariable generalized linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between tumor size and cancer stage and the following covariates: age, tumor subtype, pathogenic variant status, prevalent/incident BC status, and healthcare accessibility indicators. Within the matched cohort, those with incident BC were significantly younger at inclusion, but were of comparable age at the time of first diagnosis. They had smaller tumors, and the odds of advanced-stage disease were approximately 30% lower than those observed in women with prevalent BC (OR = 0.29, p < 0.01). Younger age and a triple-negative phenotype were independently associated with larger tumor size. No significant effect was shown from healthcare accessibility indicators. The PGO's coordinated, person-centered approach to high genetic risk management was likely associated with earlier-stage BC detection in women with the <i>BRCA</i> PV and women at high risk without <i>BRCA PV</i>. These findings both underscore the enhanced value of person-centered surveillance programs that integrate genetic risk assessment and long-term clinical follow-up, and pave the way for further research in this area.\nTitle: Oncological safety and preventive impact of nipple-sparing mastectomy in patients with BRCA1/2 mutation: multicentre study of the Korea Robot-endoscopy Minimal Access Breast Surgery Study Group (KoREa-BSG).\nJournal: BJS open (2025)\nAbstract: Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is a surgical option offering both oncological safety and cosmetic benefits. However, the oncological safety of NSM in carriers of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants/likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV) with breast cancer and the role of risk-reducing mastectomy remain underexplored, especially in Asian populations. This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of NSM in BRCA1/2 PV/LPV carriers and assessed the preventive impact of contralateral risk-reducing NSM (RRNSM) on cancer incidence. This multicentre retrospective study included women aged 20-80 years who underwent NSM for therapeutic or risk-reducing purposes and received germline BRCA1/2 tests between May 2006 and June 2022 across 19 institutions in Korea. Patients with distant metastasis at diagnosis were excluded. Information on demographics, the clinical characteristics of patients and tumours, surgical details, and follow-up outcomes was collected from a review the medical records of each participating institution. The primary outcome was the oncological safety of NSM, assessed by comparing ipsilateral local recurrence rates between patients with and without BRCA1/2 PV/LPV. The secondary outcome was cancer incidence in patients who underwent contralateral RRNSM versus those who did not. In all, 787 women underwent 906 NSMs, with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 59.3 (44.0-82.8) months. Among the participants, 186 (23.6%) were BRCA1/2 PV/LPV carriers. Ipsilateral local recurrence rates were comparable between BRCA1/2 PV/LPV carriers and non-carriers (6.4 versus 7.4%, respectively). The 5-year local recurrence-free survival rates did not differ significantly between BRCA1/2 PV/LPV carriers and non-carriers (92.2% versus 93.2%, respectively; P = 0.87). Contralateral breast cancer occurred in 4.5% of patients with BRCA1/2 PV/LPV who did not undergo contralateral RRNSM, whereas no cases of contralateral breast cancer were reported among patients who underwent RRNSM regardless of BRCA1/2 status. This study highlights NSM as a safe and effective surgical option for BRCA1/2 PV/LPV carriers with breast cancer, as well as a risk-reducing strategy. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate long-term outcomes.\nTitle: Homologous recombination deficiency in primary ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.\nJournal: Communications medicine (2026)\nAbstract: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) originating from inactivation of genes like BRCA1/BRCA2 is a targetable abnormality common in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive HER2-negative (ERpHER2n) breast cancer (BC), HRD prevalence and clinical impact are unclear. We analyzed 502 ERpHER2n tumors from patients recruited via the population-representative Swedish SCAN-B study by whole genome sequencing (WGS), defining mutational signatures-based HRD, as well as matched transcriptional, DNA methylation, clinicopathological, adjuvant treatment, and outcome data. We show that HRD is much less frequent in ERpHER2n BC (8.4%) compared to TNBC, though induced by similar genetic/epigenetic mechanisms acting on mainly BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/PALB2 together, providing a plausible HR-inactivation mechanism for 71.4% of HRD tumors. Our modelled estimate of HRD in Western European/Nordic BC is ~10-13%. HRD tumors were observed across all PAM50 gene expression subtypes with the exception of Luminal A tumors (\u2009<\u20091%) and did not exhibit a unique, defining transcriptional or DNA methylation profile. While HRD status was not statistically associated with differences in patient outcome for patients treated with combined chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, a nonsignificant trend of poorer outcome for patients with HRD tumors was observed for patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy only. ERpHER2n HRD tumors show features of aggressive disease, but do not display a distinct transcriptional or DNA methylation profile that clearly differentiates them from HR-proficient tumors. Though numbers are limited, we present early evidence that HRD stratification by WGS could impact therapeutic strategies, as HRD BCs trended to poorer outcomes when not treated with chemotherapy.\nTitle: A novel approach to silver nanoparticle biosynthesis using ursolic acid from Catharanthus roseus for therapeutic effects.\nJournal: Scientific reports (2026)\nAbstract: The present study attentive on the bio synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ursolic acid (UA-AgNPs) isolated from Catharanthus roseus and investigated their antibacterial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. The biosynthesized UA-AgNPs were characterized using techniques like UV-Vis, XRD, FT-IR, EDX, TEM, zeta potential, and DLS. The UA-AgNPs exhibited stronger antibacterial activity than ursolic acid and AgNO<sub>3</sub>, producing inhibition zones of 18.00\u00a0mm and 16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0mm against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, respectively, which were comparable to the activity of standard antibiotics and MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 6.95 and 12.39\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The anti-biofilm activity inhibited 64.43% and 60.89% of biofilm production. UA-AgNPs also impaired bacterial motility and caused higher protein and (Deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA leakage in membrane integrity assays compared to the control. Antioxidant activity was confirmed by DPPH and FRAP assays, and in vivo experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae highlighted significant antioxidant effects. Furthermore, UA-AgNPs exhibited potential anticancer activity against the HeLa cell line (IC<sub>50</sub> 29.20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) with minimal cytotoxicity on Vero cells (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.59\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). Moreover, UA-AgNPs reduced LPS-induced Nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells. Through molecular docking studies, they demonstrated interactions with breast cancer proteins BRCA1 and C-erbB2 and bacterial virulence proteins Hbl and aglD. These findings highlight the bio efficacy of UA-AgNPs as a dual-action therapeutic agent with potent antibacterial and anticancer activity, combined with low toxicity toward normal cells, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications.\nTitle: Multigene panel testing reveals the spectrum of non-BRCA germline variants in BRCA1/2-negative breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients from a Turkish cohort.\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico (2026)\nAbstract: Targeted multigene panel testing is increasingly used to assess hereditary cancer susceptibility beyond BRCA1/2. However, the distribution and clinical significance of pathogenic variants and variants of uncertainsignificance (VUS) in non-BRCA1/2 genes remain incompletely characterized. In this retrospective study, 647 individuals referred for hereditary cancer genetic testing were analyzed. Clinical indications included breast cancer, ovarian cancer, combined breast and ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, andpositive family history without personal cancer diagnosis. Germline variants were classified according to ACMG/AMP guidelines as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), VUS++, VUS, or benign/VUS. Variants categorizedas VUS or benign/VUS were not used for clinical decision-making. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16.2% (105/647) of individuals. When P/LP and VUS++ variants were considered together, the most frequently affected non-BRCA1/2 genes were CHEK2(4.0%), MUTYH (2.6%), ATM (2.2%), and TP53 (1.4%). VUS and benign/VUS variants were detected in 4.6% (30/647) and 3.1% (20/647) of individuals, respectively. CHEK2 and ATM were the genes most frequentlyassociated with VUS or benign/VUS variants. Breast cancer was the most common clinical indication among individuals carrying clinically relevant variants. Non-BRCA1/2 genes, particularly CHEK2 and ATM, substantially contribute to the spectrum of pathogenic variants detected in hereditary cancer testing. The identification of numerous pathogenic and novel variantssupports the clinical utility of broad multigene panel testing, while highlighting the need for careful interpretation of VUS in clinical practice.\nTitle: Design, synthesis and anti-breast cancer activity evaluation of 6,7-dihydro-5<i>H</i>-pyrrolo[3,4-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine-based PARP1/ATR dual inhibitors.\nJournal: Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry (2026)\nAbstract: PARP1 inhibitors are FDA-approved for BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer but show limited efficacy in wild-type cancers and face resistance issues. To overcome these, we designed novel 6,7-dihydro-5<i>H</i>-pyrrolo[3,4-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine-based compounds integrating PARP1 inhibitor pharmacophores with the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 scaffold. Substituent modifications influenced PARP1 and ATR selectivity, yielding dual inhibitors or selective PARP1 inhibitors. Compound <b>38a</b>, the lead candidate, exhibited potent dual inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> < 20\u2009nM) and strong antitumor effects in MDA-MB-231 (IC<sub>50</sub> < 0.048\u2009\u03bcM) and MDA-MB-468 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.01\u2009\u03bcM) cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. Mechanistically, <b>38a</b> arrested cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis, inhibited colony formation and migration, and suppressed DNA damage repair pathways, outperforming combined Niraparib and AZD6738. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of PARP1/ATR dual inhibitors for breast cancer and support further investigation.\nTitle: Breast cancer surgery in the era of genetic uncertainty: real-world outcomes in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance.\nJournal: BMC cancer (2026)\nAbstract: Germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become integral to the management of breast cancer, with pathogenic variants strongly influencing surgical decision-making. However, the increasing detection of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) presents a major clinical challenge, as their implications for cancer risk and treatment remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate real-world surgical management patterns among breast cancer patients carrying pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants or VUS, with a particular focus on determinants of final bilateral mastectomy. This multicenter retrospective study included female breast cancer patients who underwent germline BRCA1/2 testing across three institutions in T\u00fcrkiye between 2017 and 2025. Patients carrying pathogenic variants or VUS were identified and reclassified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between pathogenic and VUS groups. Final bilateral mastectomy was defined as either primary bilateral mastectomy or unilateral mastectomy followed by completion contralateral mastectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with final bilateral mastectomy, including a separate exploratory analysis restricted to VUS carriers. A total of 203 patients with abnormal BRCA results were included, comprising 107 pathogenic variant carriers and 96 VUS carriers. Patients with pathogenic BRCA variants were significantly younger at diagnosis and more frequently had triple-negative tumors. Final bilateral mastectomy was markedly more common among pathogenic variant carriers than VUS carriers (67% vs. 12%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable analysis, pathogenic BRCA status remained independently associated with final bilateral mastectomy (adjusted OR 10.38, 95% CI 3.98-27.10; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while increasing age was also independently associated. Among VUS carriers, no clinicopathological variable-including molecular subtype, tumor size, Ki-67 index, family history, or BRCA1 versus BRCA2 VUS-was significantly associated with final bilateral mastectomy in univariate analyses. In exploratory multivariable modeling, younger age at diagnosis emerged as the only independent factor associated with surgical choice (adjusted OR per year 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.17; p\u2009=\u20090.027). While pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants are strongly associated with bilateral mastectomy in breast cancer patients, surgical decision-making among VUS carriers appears largely independent of tumor biology or genetic subtype and is primarily influenced by age. These findings highlight substantial heterogeneity and potential overtreatment in the management of BRCA VUS carriers, underscoring the need for improved genetic counseling and standardized approaches to mitigate the impact of genetic uncertainty on clinical decision-making.\nTitle: Preliminary exploration of radiomic mammographic analysis in triple negative breast cancer related to BRCA profile.\nJournal: Scientific reports (2026)\nAbstract: This retrospective study evaluated the applicability of radiomics analysis to mammographic images of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to identify features differentiating BRCA gene's mutational status. The mammographic images of 52 patients histologically diagnosed with TNBC, (13 BRCA-mutated patients and 39 BRCA wild-type ones), were included and 53 tumor lesions were manually segmented in the mammographic projection where they were better demarcable. An additional elliptical ROI of standard size was drawn in the most homogeneous area of the contralateral healthy gland, using the analogue mammographic projection of the same date or, if not available, of the corresponding bilateral mammographic investigation closer to the time of diagnosis. Lesions consisted of 36 masses, 2 pathological microcalcifications, and 15 masses with microcalcifications. Radiomic features were extracted using Pyradiomics-3D. Preliminary analysis confirmed feasibility and showed differences in texture features, particularly GLCM SumEntropy, between BRCA-mutated and non-mutated patients. Moreover, the study enhanced the role of healthy glandular tissue in distinguishing the two groups, supporting and reinforcing previous MRI-based radiomics findings in the same population. The study concludes that radiomics analysis of diagnostic mammograms in TNBC patients is feasible and may help build predictive models to discriminate between BRCA mutated and non-mutated patients.\nTitle: [Clinical and pathological characteristics and prognostic analysis of colorectal cancer associated with breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations].\nJournal: Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology] (2026)\nAbstract: <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the mutation status of breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA) in colorectal cancer and the relationship between BRCA and the clinical-pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancer. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 132 colorectal cancer tissue specimens surgically resected at Shanxi Cancer Hospital from 2018 to 2021 were collected. Second-generation sequencing was used to detect BRCA mutations. Immunohistochemical staining assessed the infiltration density of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells. The association between BRCA mutations and clinical-pathological features, immune cell infiltration density, and prognosis of colorectal cancer was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among 132 colorectal cancer cases, the overall BRCA mutation rate was 9.09% (12/132), with BRCA1 mutation rate at 3.03% (4/132) and BRCA2 mutation rate at 6.06% (8/132). Compared with the BRCA wild-type group, the BRCA mutation group exhibited smaller tumors (<i>P</i>=0.036), less vascular or nerve invasion (<i>P</i>=0.041), and lower tumor budding grades (<i>P</i>=0.013). Tumor microenvironment analysis revealed that the infiltration densities of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the BRCA mutation group were 1 729.66 (652.91, 3 065.98)/mm\u00b2, 438.36 (97.37, 718.43)/mm\u00b2, and 1 017.86 (506.19, 2 257.35)/mm\u00b2, respectively, all higher than those in the BRCA wild-type group [555.72 (304.58, 933.26)/mm\u00b2, 89.34 (58.15, 178.35)/mm\u00b2, and 354.23 (157.78, 752.37)/mm\u00b2, respectively, all <i>P</i>\uff1c0.05]. Molecular feature analysis revealed five cases of TMB-H in the BRCA-mutant group and three cases in the BRCA-wild group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). Survival analysis revealed no association between BRCA mutation status and overall survival in colorectal cancer patients (<i>P</i>\uff1e0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified clinical stage as an independent predictor of overall survival, with patients at stages \u2162-\u2163 exhibiting poorer prognosis (<i>HR</i>=5.359, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.124-25.546). <b>Conclusion:</b> BRCA-mutated colorectal tumors exhibit lower invasiveness, higher TMB-H rates, and abundant immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that patients with BRCA-mutated colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.\nTitle: Breast Cancer Vaccines: A Review of Emerging Opportunities and Persistent Challenges.\nJournal: Clinical breast cancer (2026)\nAbstract: Breast cancer, the most diagnosed malignancy globally, poses a significant health burden, with approximately 2.3 million new cases and 700,000 deaths annually. Breast cancer vaccines represent an innovative approach to prevention and treatment, harnessing the immune system to target tumor-specific antigens such as \u03b1-lactalbumin, HER2, and MUC1. Prophylactic vaccines aim to reduce risk in high-risk groups like BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, while therapeutic vaccines, particularly for triple-negative breast cancer, stimulate T-cell responses to combat aggressive tumors. Advances in mRNA technology, nanoparticle delivery, and neoantigen identification enhance vaccine precision and efficacy. However, challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and production scalability limit clinical success. Ongoing phase I and II trials explore combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates to overcome these barriers. This review examines the current landscape, mechanisms, and challenges of breast cancer vaccines, highlighting their potential to transform oncology through personalized, less invasive strategies."
