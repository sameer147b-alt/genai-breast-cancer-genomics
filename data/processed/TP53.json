  "llm_context": "Gene: TP53\nProtein name: Cellular tumor antigen p53\nUniProt ID: O09185\nBiological function:\nMultifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence. Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (By similarity). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (By similarity). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2\nSubcellular location: Cytoplasm, Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome, Endoplasmic reticulum, Mitochondrion matrix, Nucleus, Nucleus, PML body\nRelevant breast cancer literature:\nTitle: Exploring the Anticancer Properties and Mode of Action of Copper(II)-Furan Acylhydrazone on Human Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.\nJournal: ChemMedChem (2026)\nAbstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited therapeutic treatments. This study evaluates the anticancer activity and mode of action of the copper(II) complex [Cu(HL<sup>1</sup>)(NO<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O]\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O (CuHL<sup>1</sup>), derived from (E)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)furan-2-carbohydrazide (H<sub>2</sub>L<sup>1</sup>), against a panel of TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-157, HCC1806). CuHL<sup>1</sup> exhibits potent cytotoxicity in the low micromolar range (IC<sub>50</sub>\u2009\u2248\u20092\u2009\u00b5M), surpassing cisplatin by up to 81-fold. In MDA-MB-231 cells, CuHL<sup>1</sup> inhibits colony formation and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, CuHL<sup>1</sup> triggers apoptosis as evidenced by Annexin V/PI staining and the modulation of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels. Label-free quantitative proteomics reveal 34 differentially expressed proteins, implicating pathways related to heat shock response, protein folding, lipid metabolism, and cell migration. Notably, CuHL<sup>1</sup> downregulates BCAR3, AJUBA, MPZL1, TP53, FASN, and HMGCS1, suggesting inhibition of prometastatic and lipid biosynthetic processes. Functional assays confirm reduced migratory capacity in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings position CuHL<sup>1</sup> as a promising candidate for TNBC therapy, meriting further in\u2009vivo evaluation.\nTitle: Multigene panel testing reveals the spectrum of non-BRCA germline variants in BRCA1/2-negative breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients from a Turkish cohort.\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico (2026)\nAbstract: Targeted multigene panel testing is increasingly used to assess hereditary cancer susceptibility beyond BRCA1/2. However, the distribution and clinical significance of pathogenic variants and variants of uncertainsignificance (VUS) in non-BRCA1/2 genes remain incompletely characterized. In this retrospective study, 647 individuals referred for hereditary cancer genetic testing were analyzed. Clinical indications included breast cancer, ovarian cancer, combined breast and ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, andpositive family history without personal cancer diagnosis. Germline variants were classified according to ACMG/AMP guidelines as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), VUS++, VUS, or benign/VUS. Variants categorizedas VUS or benign/VUS were not used for clinical decision-making. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16.2% (105/647) of individuals. When P/LP and VUS++ variants were considered together, the most frequently affected non-BRCA1/2 genes were CHEK2(4.0%), MUTYH (2.6%), ATM (2.2%), and TP53 (1.4%). VUS and benign/VUS variants were detected in 4.6% (30/647) and 3.1% (20/647) of individuals, respectively. CHEK2 and ATM were the genes most frequentlyassociated with VUS or benign/VUS variants. Breast cancer was the most common clinical indication among individuals carrying clinically relevant variants. Non-BRCA1/2 genes, particularly CHEK2 and ATM, substantially contribute to the spectrum of pathogenic variants detected in hereditary cancer testing. The identification of numerous pathogenic and novel variantssupports the clinical utility of broad multigene panel testing, while highlighting the need for careful interpretation of VUS in clinical practice.\nTitle: Synergistic modulation of ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance by <i>Kalanchoe laciniata</i> (L.) DC. phytochemicals: integrative phytochemical profiling, network pharmacology, and molecular docking insights.\nJournal: RSC advances (2026)\nAbstract: <i>Kalanchoe laciniata</i> (L.) DC. is an underexplored medicinal plant with promising anticancer potential. This study evaluated the phytochemical profile, antioxidant activity, and multidrug resistance (MDR) modulating effects of its methanolic extract (KLM), with emphasis on ABC transporter regulation. Soxhlet methanol extraction yielded the highest phenolic and tannin contents and exhibited strong antioxidant activity. GC-MS and LC-MS analyses identified bioactive flavonoids and phytosterols, including quercetin and kaempferol derivatives. Network pharmacology revealed key interactions with ABC transporters and hub genes such as AKT1 and TP53. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated stable binding of KLM-derived flavonoids with BCRP, MRP1, and AKT1, supporting their role in MDR modulation. Functionally, KLM exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and showed strong synergy with doxorubicin. qPCR analysis further confirmed significant downregulation of AKT1, BCRP, and MRP1 expression following KLM treatment. Collectively, these findings indicate that <i>K. laciniata</i> phytochemicals may act as effective chemosensitizing agents to overcome ABC transporter-mediated drug resistance in breast cancer.\nTitle: Investigating the Mechanisms of Combined Therapy for MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells Using Arsenic Trioxide and Resveratrol through Network Pharmacology.\nJournal: Phenomics (Cham, Switzerland) (2025)\nAbstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains the predominant form of cancer among women. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an element in traditional Chinese medicine, has shown potential for treating BC, particularly when combined with resveratrol. However, the exact mechanisms of their combined action are not fully understood. This study aims to clarify their combined mechanisms through network pharmacology and experimental validation. In vitro experiments confirmed that\u00a0compared with either agent alone, the combination of\u00a0ATO and resveratrol more effectively inhibited the production of\u00a0<i>estrogen receptor 1</i> (<i>ESR1</i>), <i>tumor protein P53</i> (<i>TP53</i>), and <i>v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1</i> (<i>AKT1</i>) in MCF-7 cells. Our findings indicate that the combination of ATO and resveratrol significantly promotes cell apoptosis by suppressing <i>ESR1</i>, <i>TP53</i>, and <i>AKT1</i>. Thus, ATO and resveratrol together may offer a promising strategy for BC treatment.\nTitle: Genomic and clinicopathological characteristics of low\u00a0oncotype recurrent score breast cancers with subsequent metastasis.\nJournal: Histopathology (2026)\nAbstract: Oncotype DX has played a critical role in guiding treatment decisions for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Clinically, a subset of patients with low Oncotype recurrent score (RS) will still progress on standard therapy and ultimately develop metastasis. Our goal was to explore potential molecular mechanisms, including specific genetic alterations and pathway activity associated with disease progression. We retrospectively reviewed a small series of low RS breast cancers with subsequent metastasis and analysed the clinicopathological characteristics and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) data from tumour tissue and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) by liquid biopsy. These tumours demonstrated a range of histopathologic features and molecular profiles. Common findings included enrichment of PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and treatment-emergent ESR1 mutations, observed in both tissue and ctDNA. CDKN2A, SPEN, KIT, CTNNB1, MYC, EMSY, KMT2C, MAP3K1 gene alterations were only found in low RS group in low frequency. Copy number amplifications events were less common in low RS group. In cases with both tissue and ctDNA data, tissue CGP proved useful baseline for identifying driver mutations such as PIK3CA and for contextualizing ctDNA findings, and ctDNA analysis was adequate for disease monitoring and tracking molecular evolution over time. Using real-world CGP of tumour tissue and ctDNA, we identified key molecular features associated with endocrine resistance in patients with low RS who later developed metastases. PIK3CA mutation and other ER group-related mutations contributed to the low RS. Tissue CGP provides baseline for interpreting ctDNA, and ctDNA monitoring PIK3CA, TP53, ESR1 and other pathogenic or driver mutations in the early course of low RS cases may represent an excellent non-invasive option for identifying targets and early intervention to prevent disease progression, though a large validation study is needed.\nTitle: Gene Expression Profiling to Unveil Novel Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis and Therapies for Breast Cancer.\nJournal: Current topics in medicinal chemistry (2026)\nAbstract: Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis can improve patient outcomes and survival rates. Thus, identifying drugs and biomarkers for early detection is necessary for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Using machine learning techniques, we identified 160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BC and control samples from four microarray datasets (GSE26910, GSE3744, GSE29431, and GSE42568), which were adopted due to the frequent presence of outliers in microarray gene-expression datasets, stemming from multiple stages in the data generation processes. Through protein-protein interaction network analysis, 10 DEGs (FN1, CXCL10, CD34, PECAM1, PTGS2, CXCL12, JUN, EGFR, CD36, and CAV1) were selected as pivotal Hub genes (HubGs) as potential biomarkers for BC. We validated the expression profiles of hub genes (HubGs) in breast cancer (BC) and control samples using box plot analysis based on data from the TCGA and GTEx databases. The identified HubGs demonstrated strong prognostic potential, as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and performance in a random forest prediction model. Regulatory network analysis revealed that HubG activity is modulated at a limited number of transcriptional and posttranscriptional stages. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted key molecular functions, cellular components, biological processes, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with BC pathogenesis and linked to these HubGs. Finally, molecular docking studies targeting HubG-mediated receptors led to the identification of seven top-ranked candidate drugs-Olaparib, Tucatinib, Telmisartan, Danazol, Troglitazone, Abemaciclib, and Lapatinib- proposed for potential BC treatment. In this study, we identified 10 critical differentially expressed genes (cDEGs)- CD34, PECAM1, PTGS2, CXCL12, JUN, EGFR, CD36, CAV1, FN1, and CXCL10-as pivotal hub genes (HubGs) involved in breast cancer (BC). These HubGs were determined through protein- protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of 160 cDEGs derived from four independent microarray datasets. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these HubGs are associated with key biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and pathways relevant to BC progression. Furthermore, we identified three top-ranked transcription factors (BRCA1, STAT3, and TP53) and three microRNAs (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-23b-3p) as crucial regulators of HubGs, acting at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The stability of the top three receptor-ligand complexes was validated through molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, our findings could be a valuable resource for researchers and medical professionals, aiding in BC diagnosis and treatment.\nTitle: Comprehensive profiling of somatic alterations and HRD characteristics in Chinese germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer patients.\nJournal: American journal of cancer research (2026)\nAbstract: Approximately 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary and associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. To characterize the somatic alteration landscape and HRD-related genomic features, we analyzed next-generation sequencing and clinical data from 1,243 breast cancer patients treated at Tianjin Cancer Hospital Airport Hospital between October 2021 and November 2024. We compared mutation patterns and clinicopathological features between patients with and without germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutations and further assessed somatic alterations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in those carrying pathogenic variants. PIK3CA mutations were significantly more frequent in the Non-Germline and non-gBRCA groups than in the Germline and gBRCA groups (49% vs. 6%; 47% vs. 0%; both P < 0.001), indicating mutual exclusivity with gBRCA mutations. Conversely, PTEN alterations co-occurred in 30% of gBRCA cases, while TP53 mutations were mutually exclusive with MDM2 and FGFR1. HER2 amplification was identified in 10% of gBRCA-mutated tumors, and somatic alterations in non-gBRCA tumors were enriched in endocrine-resistance pathways. HRD scores were markedly higher in gBRCA patients than in non-gBRCA patients (median 59 vs. 24.5, P = 0.015), driven by significant increases in large-scale state transitions (LST) and telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI). The overall gBRCA1/2 mutation frequency was 15.61%, and two previously unreported variants, BRCA1 NM_007294.3:c.4185G>A and BRCA2 NM_000059.3:c.439C>A, were identified in the Chinese population. These findings provide a biological rationale to explore AKT1/HER2-targeted combinations with PARP inhibition in future studies for gBRCA-mutated breast cancer and provide the first evidence of PIK3CA-gBRCA mutual exclusivity in Chinese patients. The elevated HRD scores further underscore the presence of homologous recombination deficiency in the gBRCA group.\nTitle: European Colonial Echoes in Cancer Risk: Lessons from the TP53 p.R337H Founder Variant in Brazil.\nJournal: Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology (2026)\nAbstract: Latin America's population is among the most genetically diverse in the world, shaped by centuries of European colonization, Indigenous American displacement, and forced African slave migration. This complex ancestry, combined with persistent social inequalities, influences cancer risk through both genetic and environmental factors. For example, Indigenous ancestry has been linked to a lower risk of breast cancer, a protective effect further influenced by reproductive patterns and access to healthcare. In this issue, Pinto and colleagues trace the history of the TP53 p.R337H founder variant, a mutation now present in about 1 in 300 people in southern Brazil. Their analysis shows that this variant was introduced during early Portuguese colonization and spread throughout Brazil as the population grew rapidly. This story highlights how historical events continue to shape cancer risk today. Founder mutations, such as TP53 p.R337H, are common across Latin America and often trace to Iberian ancestors. These variants offer unique opportunities for low-cost genetic screening and precision medicine, especially in regions with limited resources. They also serve as natural experiments for studying how genes and the environment interact to influence cancer risk. By understanding and leveraging these genetic legacies, we can enhance cancer prevention and treatment in Latin America, reduce disparities, and gain valuable insights to address global cancer health.

In this study, we assessed the prognostic and monitoring values of ctDNA at multiple clinical time points during diagnosis and therapy. A total of 119 patients with breast cancer underwent ctDNA analysis using next-generation sequencing, targeting 47 breast cancer-related genes at three predefined time points (baseline, post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy [post-NAC], and follow-up). Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed based on ctDNA status. ctDNA was detected in 50.9% of patients at baseline, 25.0% post-NAC, and 58.3% during follow-up. ctDNA positivity was associated with worse DFS at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 7.54, 95% CI: 1.71-33.17, P\u2009=\u20090.008), post-NAC (HR 3.54, 95% CI: 1.24-10.12, P\u2009=\u20090.018), and follow-up (HR 7.68, 95% CI: 0.98-59.97, P\u2009=\u20090.052). TP53 mutations were the most frequently observed, present in 37.5%, 14.8%, and 20.4% of patients at baseline, post-NAC, and follow-up, respectively. PIK3CA mutations were the second most common, detected in 11.6%, 4.5%, and 5.8% of patients, respectively. ctDNA positivity for these mutations consistently showed elevated HRs for disease progression across clinical time points (HR range, 2.73-20.49). ctDNA non-clearance was associated with the highest risk of disease progression (HR 81.09, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and remained the strongest independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 52.07, P\u2009<\u20090.001). ctDNA analysis provides significant clinical utility for prognostic stratification and disease monitoring in breast cancer management.\nTitle: Risk-Reducing Mastectomy in <i>BRCA1/2</i> and Other High-Risk Gene Carriers: Current Evidence and Practical Guidance.\nJournal: Journal of breast cancer (2025)\nAbstract: Women carrying pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of high- or moderate-penetrance genes, such as <i>BRCA1/2</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>PTEN</i>, <i>PALB2</i>, <i>CDH1</i>, <i>STK11</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, and <i>ATM</i>, face markedly elevated lifetime risks of breast cancer. Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) reduces incidence by approximately 90% as shown in large observational cohort studies and meta-analyses. However, the survival advantage of RRM remains uncertain given the observational design, heterogeneous population, and the lack of randomized controlled trials. For moderate-penetrance genes, guidance relies more on absolute risk modeling and expert consensus than on direct outcome data. Hence, RRM is recognized as an option for women at high-risk, while emphasizing individualized, multidisciplinary decision-making that incorporates oncological, genetic, reconstructive, and psychosocial perspectives. In addition, choices are shaped by many factors, such as age, family plans, culture, and healthcare systems in real practice. This review integrates the current evidence and evolving guidelines to clarify the benefits, limitations, and controversies surrounding RRM. By addressing existing knowledge gaps and decision-making challenges, it aims to facilitate informed patient-centered counseling for the management of hereditary breast cancer."
