  "llm_context": "Gene: ERBB2\nProtein name: Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2\nUniProt ID: Q60553\nBiological function:\nProtein tyrosine kinase that is part of several cell surface receptor complexes, but that apparently needs a coreceptor for ligand binding. Essential component of a neuregulin-receptor complex, although neuregulins do not interact with it alone. GP30 is a potential ligand for this receptor. Regulates outgrowth and stabilization of peripheral microtubules (MTs). Upon ERBB2 activation, the MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway elicits the phosphorylation and thus the inhibition of GSK3B at cell membrane. This prevents the phosphorylation of APC and CLASP2, allowing its association with the cell membrane. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization (By similarity) In the nucleus is involved in transcriptional regulation. Associates with the 5'-TCAAATTC-3' sequence in the PTGS2/COX-2 promoter and activates its transcription. Implicated in transcriptional activation of CDKN1A; the function involves STAT3 and SRC. Involved in the transcription of rRNA genes by RNA Pol I and enhances protein synthesis and cell growth (By similarity)\nSubcellular location: Cell membrane, Cell projection, ruffle membrane, Cytoplasm, perinuclear region, Early endosome, Nucleus\nRelevant breast cancer literature:\nTitle: A novel approach to silver nanoparticle biosynthesis using ursolic acid from Catharanthus roseus for therapeutic effects.\nJournal: Scientific reports (2026)\nAbstract: The present study attentive on the bio synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ursolic acid (UA-AgNPs) isolated from Catharanthus roseus and investigated their antibacterial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. The biosynthesized UA-AgNPs were characterized using techniques like UV-Vis, XRD, FT-IR, EDX, TEM, zeta potential, and DLS. The UA-AgNPs exhibited stronger antibacterial activity than ursolic acid and AgNO<sub>3</sub>, producing inhibition zones of 18.00\u00a0mm and 16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0mm against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, respectively, which were comparable to the activity of standard antibiotics and MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 6.95 and 12.39\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The anti-biofilm activity inhibited 64.43% and 60.89% of biofilm production. UA-AgNPs also impaired bacterial motility and caused higher protein and (Deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA leakage in membrane integrity assays compared to the control. Antioxidant activity was confirmed by DPPH and FRAP assays, and in vivo experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae highlighted significant antioxidant effects. Furthermore, UA-AgNPs exhibited potential anticancer activity against the HeLa cell line (IC<sub>50</sub> 29.20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) with minimal cytotoxicity on Vero cells (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.59\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). Moreover, UA-AgNPs reduced LPS-induced Nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells. Through molecular docking studies, they demonstrated interactions with breast cancer proteins BRCA1 and C-erbB2 and bacterial virulence proteins Hbl and aglD. These findings highlight the bio efficacy of UA-AgNPs as a dual-action therapeutic agent with potent antibacterial and anticancer activity, combined with low toxicity toward normal cells, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications.\nTitle: Tumor-Associated Neutrophils and Desmoplastic Reaction in Breast Cancer Microenvironment: Association with Tumor Grade and Clinicopathological Features.\nJournal: Cancers (2026)\nAbstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of diverse immune and stromal cells, plays a key role in cancer progression. Among its components, tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and the desmoplastic reaction (DR) have emerged as important modulators of tumor behavior. While each has been extensively studied, their interrelationship and association with tumor grade and clinicopathological parameters remain unclear. This hypothesis-generating study aimed to explore the relationship between the presence of TANs, various types of DR, the grade of tumor malignancy, and other fundamental clinicopathological characteristics commonly studied in daily clinical practice. The study included a cohort of 65 cancer patients (N = 65). The average number of TANs was recorded. In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections, \"hot spots\" representing areas with the highest neutrophil density were first identified. The tumor-associated polymorphonuclear neutrophils were then counted in ten consecutive high-power fields (HPFs). In the same specimens, the DR was assessed and classified according to stromal texture. TANs did not follow a normal distribution across any clinicopathological category (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Significant differences in TAN levels were observed among DR types (Kruskal-Wallis H = 9.890, <i>p</i> = 0.007), with higher counts in myxoid compared to mature stroma (Mean Rank = 41.58 vs. 24.80, <i>p</i> = 0.006). TAN levels also varied significantly with tumor grade (H = 22.384, <i>p</i> < 0.001), increasing from Grade 1 to Grade 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.013-0.001). Higher TAN counts were associated with cellular erythroblastic oncogene B2 (c-erbB2) positivity (H = 6.547, <i>p</i> = 0.038), perineural invasion (Mann-Whitney U = 179.5, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and ER/PR negativity (<i>p</i> = 0.016 and <i>p</i> = 0.044, respectively). No significant association was found with necrosis (<i>p</i> = 0.083). A near-significant relationship was identified between DR type and tumor differentiation grade (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 9.448, <i>p</i> = 0.051), with mature stroma most common in Grade 1 tumors, keloid-like stroma in Grade 2, and myxoid stroma in Grade 3. High TAN levels were linked to aggressive tumor features and specific DR patterns. The association of myxoid stroma with elevated TAN infiltration may reflect a highly aggressive TME. These preliminary results warrant validation in larger, prospective studies.\nTitle: Validation of the HER2DX genomic test in first-line advanced HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane.\nJournal: NPJ breast cancer (2026)\nAbstract: Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (THP) has been the standard first-line therapy for HER2+ advanced breast cancer for over a decade. With new regimens emerging, genomic tools like HER2DX may help identify patients who benefit durably from THP versus those requiring intensification. Here, baseline tumor tissue from 122 patients with HER2+ treated with THP in Poland was tested with HER2DX. A previously published Spanish real-world cohort (n\u2009=\u200993) was added to generate a combined cohort (n\u2009=\u2009215). Univariable analyses were performed in the Polish cohort, and multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were applied to the combined cohort. A HER2DX metastatic prognostic score was trained on overall survival (OS) in the Spanish cohort and validated in the Polish cohort. In the Polish cohort, high ERBB2 mRNA scores were associated with significantly longer real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) (33.8 vs. 17.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; p\u2009=\u20090.022) and real-world overall survival (rwOS) (75.1 vs. 40.2; HR 0.48; p\u2009=\u20090.009). In the combined cohort, ERBB2 high-score tumors showed prolonged rwPFS (33.8 vs. 12.5; HR 0.50; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and rwOS (not reached vs. 37.1; HR 0.36; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher rwORR (84.4% vs. 52.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Prognostic value was independent of clinical variables, including number of metastatic sites. Subgroup analyses showed particularly favorable outcomes in patients with <3 sites (median rwPFS 51.7 vs. 20.3 months). The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score outperformed ERBB2 alone in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA score provides independent prognostic information in HER2+ advanced breast cancer treated with THP. The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score further improves prognostic accuracy.\nTitle: Predictive factors and prognostic significance of HER2-low early breast cancer with long-term follow-up.\nJournal: Surgical oncology (2026)\nAbstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor type2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has emerged as a clinically relevant subtype with novel HER2-targeted therapies. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic implications of HER2-low status in patients with early breast cancer undergoing long-term follow-up. We retrospectively analyzed patients with HER2-negative early breast cancer who underwent surgery between 2003 and 2022. We investigated clinicopathological factors associated with HER2-low status and the clinical impacts of HER2-low/zero status on disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) according to hormone receptor (HR) status using univariate and multivariate analyses. Among 3663 patients with early breast cancer, we identified 2519 HER2-negative patients (HER2-low 57%, HER2-zero 28%). HER2-low status was associated with high estrogen-receptor (ER) positivity (Allred score 8) and less mucinous histology, but there was no association with progesterone receptor (PgR) expression. HER2-low status also tended to be associated with pre/perimenopausal status and higher nuclear grade (\u22652), but not with tumor size or lobular/metaplastic type. Pathological complete response rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were comparable between HER2-low (18.9%) and HER2-zero (21.6%), with no survival differences. HER2 status (low vs. zero) was not significantly associated with DFS, DDFS, or OS, and had no prognostic impact in patients with either HR-positive or -negative disease. HER2-low breast cancer was characterized by distinct biological features, including high ER positivity (especially Allred score 8) without PgR association, but did not confer a prognostic advantage over HER2-zero disease. HER2-low status may reflect biological heterogeneity that could be relevant when interpreting treatment response rather than serving as an independent prognostic marker.\nTitle: Clinical decision impact of HER2DX, an algorithm-powered genomic diagnostic in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: results from a prospective real-world study.\nJournal: ESMO real world data and digital oncology (2025)\nAbstract: HER2DX is a clinically available genomic assay that provides prognostic (relapse risk score), predictive [pathological complete response (pCR) likelihood score], and <i>ERBB2</i> expression data in stage I-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC). This real-world study evaluated its clinical impact. This prospective study enrolled newly diagnosed patients with stage I-III HER2-positive BC across 12 hospitals in Spain (November 2021-September 2024). Thirty-four oncologists ordered HER2DX and completed questionnaires before and after receiving results to assess treatment changes (primary objective). Secondary objectives included evaluating the HER2DX pCR likelihood score association with pCR, test turnaround time, changes in physician confidence regarding treatment decisions, and cost-effectiveness. Among 297 recruited patients, 48.1% (95% confidence interval 42.5% to 53.7%) experienced treatment adjustments after HER2DX. Within these cases, 73.5% involved reduced treatment intensity, 24.5% involved increased treatment intensity, and the remaining cases (2.0%) involved mixed adjustments. Of the cases with reduced treatment intensity, 56.2% had a reduction in chemotherapy intensity, 26.7% had a reduction in anti-HER2 therapy, and 17.1% in both. Among the 182 patients with available pathological data at surgery, the pCR likelihood score was a significant predictor of pCR (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In 69 patients with pCR-high disease, less intensive treatment achieved similar pCR rates compared with multi-agent chemotherapy (81.5% versus 69.0%; odds ratio = 1.97, <i>P</i> = 0.256). Physician confidence improved (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and the estimated total cost savings, including direct drug costs, vein access devices, and HER2DX costs, amounted to \u20ac98\u2009031. HER2DX impacts clinical management in stage I-III HER2-positive BC by supporting treatment adjustments, enhancing physician confidence, maintaining pCR rates, and reducing health care costs.\nTitle: Adjuvant Chemotherapy Use for Hormone Receptor-Positive, ERBB2-Negative Breast Cancer After RxPONDER Trial.\nJournal: JAMA network open (2025)\nAbstract: Since 2018, the TAILORx and RxPONDER trials have demonstrated that the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) can be indicative of the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer with 3 or fewer positive lymph nodes. However, its applicability to key subgroups with high risk for recurrence, including premenopausal women with positive lymph nodes and racial and ethnic minority individuals, remains unclear. To assess the temporal patterns of and disparities in adjuvant chemotherapy use in early-stage HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer by age, genomic risk, and nodal involvement. This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from the 2010 to 2022 National Cancer Database. The cohort included women with stage I to III, HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer who had undergone a lumpectomy or mastectomy and were eligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were categorized into premenopausal (aged \u226450 years) or postmenopausal (aged >50 years) status. Nodal status (negative or positive) was pathologically confirmed. RS was classified per the TAILORx trial, with RS of 0 to 10 as low genomic risk, RS of 11 to 25 as intermediate genomic risk, and RS of 26 or higher as high genomic risk. Data were analyzed from January 20 to August 11, 2025. Adjuvant systemic therapy, defined as receipt of either endocrine therapy alone or chemoendocrine therapy (chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy), after surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy). A total of 504\u202f937 women (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [10.7] years; 5.4% Hispanic, 4.3% non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 8.1% non-Hispanic Black, 81.3% non-Hispanic White, and 0.9% other race or ethnicity) were included. Among premenopausal patients with node-negative tumors, adjuvant chemotherapy use decreased from 6.5% in 2010 to 0.9% in 2022 for those with low genomic risk and from 29.6% in 2010 to 11.1% in 2022 for those with intermediate genomic risk. However, among premenopausal patients with node-positive disease, chemotherapy use declined from 33.3% in 2010 to 12.7% in 2019 but increased to 25.7% in 2022 for the low genomic risk group. For the intermediate genomic risk group, chemotherapy use declined from 55.8% in 2010 to 38.1% in 2019 but increased to 48.9% in 2022. Among postmenopausal women, chemotherapy use for those with low to intermediate genomic risk continued to decrease from 2010 to 2022 in both node-negative and node-positive disease status. Black women with high genomic risk had lower odds of chemotherapy receipt than White women, regardless of menopausal or nodal status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). Premenopausal Black women with low to intermediate genomic risk also had lower odds of chemotherapy receipt than White women (AOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94), regardless of nodal status. This retrospective cohort study found that adjuvant chemotherapy use almost doubled in premenopausal patients with node-positive tumors and with a low to intermediate genomic risk from 2019 to 2022 but decreased for patients with node-negative disease, coinciding with the publication of the TAILORx and RxPONDER trials. The findings highlight the variability in genomic assay use to facilitate adjuvant therapy recommendations for HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer.\nTitle: Cytotoxic and immunomodulatory activity of CD151-LEL-based peptides in breast cancer and THP-1 cells.\nJournal: Human immunology (2026)\nAbstract: CD151, a cell surface oncoprotein belongs to the tetraspanin family, drives metastasis, drug resistance, and immune escape, and is recognized as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). In the screening phase, a positive correlation between CD151 expression and amplification of CCND1, ERBB2, and MYC genes as well with breast cancer (BC) metastasis was observed using data from different GEO datasets. This study identified three immunogenic peptides within the large extracellular loop (LEL) of CD151 using in silico approaches: one each of CTL and HTL epitope, which bind strongly to class I and II MHC molecules, and one B-cell epitope, eliciting a robust IgG immune response. In the validation phase, a multiepitope was constructed by incorporating high immunogenic peptides and adjuvants, which showed significant antigenicity and broader population coverage. The results also showed a hierarchy in the binding of multiepitope with key immune receptor molecules, highlighting their potential in activating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation and normal mode analysis studies uncovered a strong interaction between the multiepitope construct and TLR2. The simulation of immune system activation by the multiepitope construct using the C-ImmSim web server showed a strong B- and T-cell response with potential activation of natural killer and dendritic cells. The results also showed active antigen internalization by macrophages, their presentation to other immune cells, and IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion. In addition, AntiCP web server predicted both CTL and HTL epitopes as anticancer peptides. The in vitro study validated that synthetic peptides corresponding to CD151-LEL-based CTL and HTL peptides induced cytotoxicity in BC cell lines MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7. They reduced the CCND1mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, while MYC mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. Also, they significantly induced the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 while reducing the secretion of IL-10. Furthermore, conditioned media from the treated BC cells induced the proliferation of PMA treated monocyte like THP-1 cells and provoked the secretion of IL-6, while reducing IL-10. These findings suggest that the CD151-LEL-based peptides and their engineered multiepitope construct represent a prospective vaccine candidate for in vivo experimental validation, which can be used as a therapeutic vaccine for breast cancer.\nTitle: [Alterations in the transcriptional profile of genes in tumors as a prerequisite for personalization of treatment in breast cancer patients].\nJournal: Arkhiv patologii (2026)\nAbstract: To evaluate changes in gene expression activity during preoperative testing for tumor hormone sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ESR+/HER2- breast cancer. The study included 174 breast cancer patients. Pathological examination of FFPE core biopsy specimens, performed before the hormone response test, and surgical specimens were examined, as well as immunohistochemistry (Ki67, ER, PR, HER2/neu) and molecular genetic testing of an expression panel of 45 target genes using quantitative real-time PCR. The use of aromatase inhibitors in the preoperative hormone response test is accompanied by statistically significant changes in the mRNA expression of 37 genes in breast tumors, of which a decrease in the expression level was found for 35 genes (<i>ESR1, PGR, AR, ERBB2, FGFR4, MKI67, MYBL2, CCNB1, AURKA, BIRC5, CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A, KIF14, PPP2R2A, PTTG1, TMEM45B, TPX2, ANLN, MMP11, CTSL2, EMSY, PAK1, BCL2, BAG1, PTEN, TYMS, EXO1, UBE2T, NAT1, SCGB2A2, GATA3, FOXA1, ZNF703, CD274/PD-L1</i>), an increase - for two genes (<i>SFRP1, KRT5</i>). While the use of tamoxifen statistically significantly correlates with a decrease in the level of mRNA expression of 35 genes: <i>ESR1, PGR, AR, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR4, MKI67, MYBL2, CCNB1, AURKA, BIRC5, CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A, KIF14, PPP2R2A, PTTG1, TMEM45A, TMEM45B, TPX2, ANLN, MMP11, EMSY, PAK1, BCL2, BAG1, PTEN, TYMS, EXO1, UBE2T, NAT1, GATA3, FOXA1, ZNF703, CD274/PD-L1</i>, and an increase in only one gene - <i>MYC</i>. Comparative mRNA expression analysis confirms that a short preoperative course of aromatase inhibitors induces a more potent and uniform molecular response, characterized by profound suppression of proliferation and complete inhibition of estrogen-dependent signaling. Tamoxifen therapy is also effective but results in less pronounced suppression of key targets and, crucially, may be accompanied by early activation of the <i>MYC</i> oncogene, a potential marker for resistance development.\nTitle: Molecular and socioeconomic characteristics of inflammatory breast cancer in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study.\nJournal: Breast cancer research and treatment (2026)\nAbstract: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) has been hypothesized to represent a distinct molecular subtype. However, few IBC-specific gene expression patterns have been identified, and previous genomic studies of IBC have been small with limited information on social determinants. We identified 153 IBC cases in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (total N\u2009=\u20094,739). RNA expression was measured on the NanoString platform (N\u2009=\u200974 IBC, 2,696 non-IBC) and used to determine molecular subtypes, including PAM50, immune, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and P53 status. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of associations between IBC and patient demographic, molecular, and social characteristics using logistic regression, and compared differences in gene expression using ANOVA. Women with IBC were associated with Black and under 50 compared to non-IBC. IBC was associated with rural address (OR\u2009=\u20091.53) and poverty (OR\u2009=\u20091.61). Molecularly, IBC was associated with HER2-enriched (OR\u2009=\u20096.14), Luminal B (OR\u2009=\u20092.90), P53 Mutant-like (OR\u2009=\u20091.79), and high HRD (OR\u2009=\u20091.90). Neither adiposity nor immune subtype was significantly associated with IBC. Only six of 219 genes measured were significantly differentially expressed between IBC and non-IBC, including HER2-related (ERBB2, FGFR4, GRB7) and P53-related genes (BTG2, LOC400043, MAP2K4). Although not associated with immune subtypes, IBC showed differences in HER2 and P53 pathways. The association of IBC with rurality and poverty underscores the importance of health care access for timely diagnosis and treatment of IBC.\nTitle: Chronic low-dose cadmium exposure accelerates the onset and metastasis of invasive mammary carcinoma and promotes immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in BALB-neuT mice.\nJournal: Ecotoxicology and environmental safety (2026)\nAbstract: Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal known to act as an endocrine disruptor, has been implicated in breast cancer (BC) via mechanisms that involve both estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and -independent pathways. We used BALB-neuT transgenic mice, a model of aggressive ErbB2-driven mammary carcinogenesis, to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to an environmentally relevant, low-dose of Cd on tumor onset, multiplicity, progression, immune microenvironment, and metastasis. Cd exposure significantly accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor multiplicity and weight, reducing both tumor-free and overall survival. Cd-exposed mice displayed elevated serum estrogen levels, and increased expression of progesterone receptor and tumor progression markers, including CD31, Ki67, and phosphorylated Akt, in tumor tissues. Despite the increased recruitment of CD4\u207a and CD8\u207a T cells to the peritumoral stroma, Cd exposure fostered an immunosuppressive microenvironment with elevated Tregs and PD-1\u207a exhausted T cells, both locally and systemically. Notably, lung metastases were threefold more frequent in Cd-exposed mice. Our results demonstrate that low-dose Cd exposure promotes the development and progression of ErbB2-driven breast tumors through hormonal, proliferative, and immune-modulating mechanisms. These findings reveal that exposure to environmentally relevant doses of Cd not only accelerates ErbB2-driven breast cancer but also reshapes the immune landscape toward dysfunction and immunosuppression, likely compromising both anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapies. These data advocate for tighter regulation of Cd exposure in populations at risk for breast cancer."
