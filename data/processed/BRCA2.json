  "llm_context": "Gene: BRCA2\nProtein name: Breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein\nUniProt ID: P51587\nBiological function:\nInvolved in double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SEM1, and is required to prevent R-loop-associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180)\nSubcellular location: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome, Nucleus\nDisease relevance:\n- A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue. Breast neoplasms can be distinguished by their histologic pattern. Invasive ductal carcinoma is by far the most common type. Breast cancer is etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Important genetic factors have been indicated by familial occurrence and bilateral involvement. Mutations at more than one locus can be involved in different families or even in the same case.\n- A condition associated with familial predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovaries. Characteristic features in affected families are an early age of onset of breast cancer (often before age 50), increased chance of bilateral cancers (cancer that develop in both breasts, or both ovaries, independently), frequent occurrence of breast cancer among men, increased incidence of tumors of other specific organs, such as the prostate.\n- A disorder affecting all bone marrow elements and resulting in anemia, leukopenia and thrombopenia. It is associated with cardiac, renal and limb malformations, dermal pigmentary changes, and a predisposition to the development of malignancies. At the cellular level it is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, chromosomal instability (increased chromosome breakage) and defective DNA repair.\n- A malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. Tumors can arise from both the exocrine and endocrine portions of the pancreas, but 95% of them develop from the exocrine portion, including the ductal epithelium, acinar cells, connective tissue, and lymphatic tissue.\n- Gliomas are benign or malignant central nervous system neoplasms derived from glial cells. They comprise astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme that are derived from astrocytes, oligodendrogliomas derived from oligodendrocytes and ependymomas derived from ependymocytes.\n- Malignant, invasive embryonal tumor of the cerebellum with a preferential manifestation in children.\nRelevant breast cancer literature:\nTitle: From genetic risk to early detection - clinical outcomes of a person-centered screening program for women with a high genetic risk of breast cancer.\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology (2025)\nAbstract: There is little evidence on breast cancer (BC) diagnosed in women with a high genetic risk, before and after their inclusion in a long-term risk management program based on genetic risk assessment. We analyzed clinical outcomes in women enrolled in the Phare Grand Ouest (PGO) program. The PGO includes carriers of the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> pathogenic variants (PV) and women at high risk without <i>BRCA PV</i>, enrolled in eight cancer genetics units. The study population included all women with incident or prevalent BC, and 1:1 matching by age at first diagnosis was conducted. Multivariable generalized linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between tumor size and cancer stage and the following covariates: age, tumor subtype, pathogenic variant status, prevalent/incident BC status, and healthcare accessibility indicators. Within the matched cohort, those with incident BC were significantly younger at inclusion, but were of comparable age at the time of first diagnosis. They had smaller tumors, and the odds of advanced-stage disease were approximately 30% lower than those observed in women with prevalent BC (OR = 0.29, p < 0.01). Younger age and a triple-negative phenotype were independently associated with larger tumor size. No significant effect was shown from healthcare accessibility indicators. The PGO's coordinated, person-centered approach to high genetic risk management was likely associated with earlier-stage BC detection in women with the <i>BRCA</i> PV and women at high risk without <i>BRCA PV</i>. These findings both underscore the enhanced value of person-centered surveillance programs that integrate genetic risk assessment and long-term clinical follow-up, and pave the way for further research in this area.\nTitle: Homologous recombination deficiency in primary ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.\nJournal: Communications medicine (2026)\nAbstract: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) originating from inactivation of genes like BRCA1/BRCA2 is a targetable abnormality common in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive HER2-negative (ERpHER2n) breast cancer (BC), HRD prevalence and clinical impact are unclear. We analyzed 502 ERpHER2n tumors from patients recruited via the population-representative Swedish SCAN-B study by whole genome sequencing (WGS), defining mutational signatures-based HRD, as well as matched transcriptional, DNA methylation, clinicopathological, adjuvant treatment, and outcome data. We show that HRD is much less frequent in ERpHER2n BC (8.4%) compared to TNBC, though induced by similar genetic/epigenetic mechanisms acting on mainly BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/PALB2 together, providing a plausible HR-inactivation mechanism for 71.4% of HRD tumors. Our modelled estimate of HRD in Western European/Nordic BC is ~10-13%. HRD tumors were observed across all PAM50 gene expression subtypes with the exception of Luminal A tumors (\u2009<\u20091%) and did not exhibit a unique, defining transcriptional or DNA methylation profile. While HRD status was not statistically associated with differences in patient outcome for patients treated with combined chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, a nonsignificant trend of poorer outcome for patients with HRD tumors was observed for patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy only. ERpHER2n HRD tumors show features of aggressive disease, but do not display a distinct transcriptional or DNA methylation profile that clearly differentiates them from HR-proficient tumors. Though numbers are limited, we present early evidence that HRD stratification by WGS could impact therapeutic strategies, as HRD BCs trended to poorer outcomes when not treated with chemotherapy.\nTitle: Breast cancer surgery in the era of genetic uncertainty: real-world outcomes in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance.\nJournal: BMC cancer (2026)\nAbstract: Germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become integral to the management of breast cancer, with pathogenic variants strongly influencing surgical decision-making. However, the increasing detection of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) presents a major clinical challenge, as their implications for cancer risk and treatment remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate real-world surgical management patterns among breast cancer patients carrying pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants or VUS, with a particular focus on determinants of final bilateral mastectomy. This multicenter retrospective study included female breast cancer patients who underwent germline BRCA1/2 testing across three institutions in T\u00fcrkiye between 2017 and 2025. Patients carrying pathogenic variants or VUS were identified and reclassified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between pathogenic and VUS groups. Final bilateral mastectomy was defined as either primary bilateral mastectomy or unilateral mastectomy followed by completion contralateral mastectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with final bilateral mastectomy, including a separate exploratory analysis restricted to VUS carriers. A total of 203 patients with abnormal BRCA results were included, comprising 107 pathogenic variant carriers and 96 VUS carriers. Patients with pathogenic BRCA variants were significantly younger at diagnosis and more frequently had triple-negative tumors. Final bilateral mastectomy was markedly more common among pathogenic variant carriers than VUS carriers (67% vs. 12%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable analysis, pathogenic BRCA status remained independently associated with final bilateral mastectomy (adjusted OR 10.38, 95% CI 3.98-27.10; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while increasing age was also independently associated. Among VUS carriers, no clinicopathological variable-including molecular subtype, tumor size, Ki-67 index, family history, or BRCA1 versus BRCA2 VUS-was significantly associated with final bilateral mastectomy in univariate analyses. In exploratory multivariable modeling, younger age at diagnosis emerged as the only independent factor associated with surgical choice (adjusted OR per year 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.17; p\u2009=\u20090.027). While pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants are strongly associated with bilateral mastectomy in breast cancer patients, surgical decision-making among VUS carriers appears largely independent of tumor biology or genetic subtype and is primarily influenced by age. These findings highlight substantial heterogeneity and potential overtreatment in the management of BRCA VUS carriers, underscoring the need for improved genetic counseling and standardized approaches to mitigate the impact of genetic uncertainty on clinical decision-making.\nTitle: [Clinical and pathological characteristics and prognostic analysis of colorectal cancer associated with breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations].\nJournal: Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology] (2026)\nAbstract: <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the mutation status of breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA) in colorectal cancer and the relationship between BRCA and the clinical-pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancer. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 132 colorectal cancer tissue specimens surgically resected at Shanxi Cancer Hospital from 2018 to 2021 were collected. Second-generation sequencing was used to detect BRCA mutations. Immunohistochemical staining assessed the infiltration density of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells. The association between BRCA mutations and clinical-pathological features, immune cell infiltration density, and prognosis of colorectal cancer was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among 132 colorectal cancer cases, the overall BRCA mutation rate was 9.09% (12/132), with BRCA1 mutation rate at 3.03% (4/132) and BRCA2 mutation rate at 6.06% (8/132). Compared with the BRCA wild-type group, the BRCA mutation group exhibited smaller tumors (<i>P</i>=0.036), less vascular or nerve invasion (<i>P</i>=0.041), and lower tumor budding grades (<i>P</i>=0.013). Tumor microenvironment analysis revealed that the infiltration densities of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the BRCA mutation group were 1 729.66 (652.91, 3 065.98)/mm\u00b2, 438.36 (97.37, 718.43)/mm\u00b2, and 1 017.86 (506.19, 2 257.35)/mm\u00b2, respectively, all higher than those in the BRCA wild-type group [555.72 (304.58, 933.26)/mm\u00b2, 89.34 (58.15, 178.35)/mm\u00b2, and 354.23 (157.78, 752.37)/mm\u00b2, respectively, all <i>P</i>\uff1c0.05]. Molecular feature analysis revealed five cases of TMB-H in the BRCA-mutant group and three cases in the BRCA-wild group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). Survival analysis revealed no association between BRCA mutation status and overall survival in colorectal cancer patients (<i>P</i>\uff1e0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified clinical stage as an independent predictor of overall survival, with patients at stages \u2162-\u2163 exhibiting poorer prognosis (<i>HR</i>=5.359, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.124-25.546). <b>Conclusion:</b> BRCA-mutated colorectal tumors exhibit lower invasiveness, higher TMB-H rates, and abundant immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that patients with BRCA-mutated colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.\nTitle: Case Report: Individualized circulating tumor DNA monitoring guides olaparib adjuvant therapy: an early-stage breast cancer case with somatic BRCA2 mutation.\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology (2026)\nAbstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has demonstrated a strong predictive capacity for recurrence in early-stage breast cancer compared with imaging examinations. However, there remains a paucity of robust clinical evidence to guide the adjustment of adjuvant therapy based on minimal residual disease (MRD) status in early-stage breast cancer. A 69-year-old female patient with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with somatic BRCA2 mutations exhibited an exceptional response to adjuvant therapy with olaparib. Personalized ctDNA monitoring, utilizing a tumor-informed approach, was employed alongside imaging examinations and tumor biomarker testing to monitor tumor recurrence. MRD positivity was detected at four months and approximately one-month post-treatment discontinuation. Resumption of olaparib therapy resulted in a negative MRD status, while imaging examinations consistently demonstrated no evidence of recurrence in the patient. This report underscores the potential benefit of olaparib for early-stage TNBC patients with somatic BRCA2 mutations and the utility of serial ctDNA monitoring for tailoring individualized treatment strategies.\nTitle: Frequency of Founder Mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> Genes in Hereditary Breast Cancers in Poland vs. Other Countries.\nJournal: Cancers (2026)\nAbstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, and genetic factors may influence its development. Approximately 10-15% of all BCs are hereditary and known as Hereditary Breast Cancer (HBC). A remarkable family history and young onset are the strongest risk factors of HBC. The rapid development of genetic testing techniques has increased the detection rate of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in several genes associated with high, moderate, or low risk of HBC. This allowed us to identify the whole family at risk of HBC. Among hereditary cases, pathogenic variants (PVs) in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes are particularly notable, especially in certain populations where founder mutations (specific genetic variants originating from a common ancestor) are more prevalent. In this article, an overview of the current state of knowledge on HBC is provided, focusing on the frequency of founder mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes in HBC in Poland compared to other countries. We will also highlight the role of genetic counseling in the diagnosis and treatment of BC, emphasizing its crucial importance in identifying genetic predispositions, selecting appropriate therapeutic strategies, and supporting patients and their families in making informed medical decisions.\nTitle: Research Progress on <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> Mutations in Sporadic Gastric Cancer: Risk Stratification, Surgical Prognosis, and Individualized Treatment.\nJournal: Annali italiani di chirurgia (2026)\nAbstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. Sporadic gastric cancer accounts for more than 80% of all gastric cancer cases, and its pronounced heterogeneity underlies the substantial variability in clinical outcomes and the complexity of treatment strategies. The breast cancer gene 1 (<i>BRCA1</i>) and breast cancer gene 2 (<i>BRCA2</i>) are core regulators of the DNA damage homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and their pathogenic mutations are closely associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Recent evidence has shown that <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations also exist in some sporadic gastric cancer patients and may profoundly affect tumor biological behavior, clinical prognosis, and treatment response. This article systematically reviews the latest research progress on <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations in sporadic gastric cancer, focusing on their incidence and molecular characteristics, their impact on patients' postoperative prognosis, and their potential value as novel biomarkers for guiding individualized therapy, thereby providing a theoretical basis for clinical risk stratification and tailored treatment strategies.\nTitle: Determinants of intention to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy among high-risk women for breast and ovarian cancer.\nJournal: Scientific reports (2026)\nAbstract: To evaluate the intention of women at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) after genetic testing, and to identify the main factors related to their decision-making. A prospective cohort study conducted at the high-risk outpatient clinic of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), including 355 high-risk women followed between November/2021 and October/2022. Participants answered clinical and sociodemographic questionnaires, underwent comprehensive genetic testing, and received pre- and post-test genetic counseling. The majority were white (60.3%), younger than 50 years (71.5%) with a mean age of 43 years, and premenopausal (61.6%). 355 patients were tested and 102 (28,7%) carried likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants, 59,3% in the BRCA 1 and 2 genes. Before testing, 42.5% expressed the intention to undergo RRSO, which decreased to 33.4% after counseling (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The pre-test desire was more frequent in women aged 40-49 years, premenopausal, and with higher education (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In multiple regression, the desire for risk-reducing mastectomy (OR\u2009\u2248\u200939, 95% CI 16,8-90,79, p\u2009<\u20090,0001), the presence of pathogenic variants in BRCA (OR 15,46, 95% CI 6.05-39.53, p\u2009<\u20090,0001), and a personal history of cancer (OR 2,69, 95% CI 1.52-4.75, p\u2009<\u20090,0001) were independently associated with the intention to undergo RRSO. Intention to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy was higher among younger and premenopausal women and those with higher educational attainment and was strongly associated with the desire to undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. Changes in intention after genetic testing reflected gene-specific risk stratification: intention was withdrawn predominantly among women without high-penetrance BRCA variants, whereas it was adopted primarily among those carrying pathogenic variants in high-risk genes. These findings underscore the importance of access to germline genetic testing to support individualized, risk-informed decision-making regarding high-complexity preventive strategies.\nTitle: RAD51 succinylation regulates homologous recombination and contributes to the chemosensitivity in cancer.\nJournal: Molecular cell (2026)\nAbstract: Genomic instability and metabolic reprogramming are core hallmarks of cancer, yet how they are mechanistically interconnected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolite and protein succinylation donor, modulates homologous recombination (HR) by regulating RAD51 succinylation. OXCT1 succinylates RAD51 at K285, whereas HDAC11 removes this modification. RAD51 succinylation disrupts BRCA2 interaction, impairs RAD51 foci formation, and suppresses HR. Upon DNA damage, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC11 enhances the interaction with RAD51, promoting RAD51 desuccinylation and inhibiting HR. In breast cancer models, elevated RAD51 succinylation correlates with reduced HR capacity and increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, whereas diminished succinylation confers resistance. Moreover, a cell-penetrating peptide that disrupts the RAD51-HDAC11 interaction increases RAD51 succinylation and synergizes with chemotherapy. Collectively, our findings uncover a metabolic-epigenetic mechanism linking protein succinylation to HR and genomic stability and identify RAD51 succinylation as a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.\nTitle: Prevalence of <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> Germline Mutations in Vietnamese Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nJournal: Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center (2026)\nAbstract: IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 10-20% of all breast cancer cases and is frequently associated with <i>BRCA1</i> mutations. Numerous studies from Western populations have investigated the prevalence of germline <i>BRCA</i> mutations in individuals with TNBC; however, the prevalence of <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations in TNBC patients varies widely between countries and from study to study. Evidence from Asian populations, particularly Vietnamese patients, remains limited. In this study, we determined the prevalence of germline <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations among unselected Vietnamese patients with TNBC and analyzed the clinicopathological features.MethodsWe conducted a single-center retrospective study of 68 women diagnosed with TNBC at the Vietnam National Cancer Hospital. Germline <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> testing was performed by next-generation sequencing.ResultsOverall, 19 Vietnamese patients (27.9%) had <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, with 14 (20.6%) in <i>BRCA1</i> and 5 (7.4%) in <i>BRCA2</i>. Three patients (4.4%) had variants of uncertain significance (2 <i>BRCA1</i> mutations and 1 <i>BRCA2</i> mutation). Thirteen distinct pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (8 <i>BRCA1</i> and 5 <i>BRCA2</i>) were found. Among patients diagnosed at \u226460\u00a0years, the prevalence of <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations was 32.0%. The average age at diagnosis for <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutation carriers was notably lower than that observed in non-carriers (43.1 vs 51.7\u00a0years, <i>P</i> = .021). <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutation carriers were also more frequently premenopausal (78.6% vs 43.9%, <i>P</i> = .025).ConclusionsThere is a high prevalence of <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations among TNBC patients in Vietnam. Women with TNBC in Vietnam should be screened for mutations in <i>BRCA1/2</i>."
