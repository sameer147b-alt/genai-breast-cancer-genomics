BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair.
Mutations in BRCA1 significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

TP53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer.
It regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis.

HER2 (ERBB2) amplification leads to aggressive breast cancer subtypes.
HER2-positive cancers respond to targeted therapies like trastuzumab.

Hormone receptor-positive breast cancers express estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) receptors.
These cancers are commonly treated with hormone therapy.

Triple-negative breast cancer lacks ER, PR, and HER2 expression.
It is aggressive and has limited targeted treatment options.
