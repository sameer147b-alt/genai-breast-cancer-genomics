    "abstract": "The present study attentive on the bio synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ursolic acid (UA-AgNPs) isolated from Catharanthus roseus and investigated their antibacterial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. The biosynthesized UA-AgNPs were characterized using techniques like UV-Vis, XRD, FT-IR, EDX, TEM, zeta potential, and DLS. The UA-AgNPs exhibited stronger antibacterial activity than ursolic acid and AgNO<sub>3</sub>, producing inhibition zones of 18.00\u00a0mm and 16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0mm against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, respectively, which were comparable to the activity of standard antibiotics and MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 6.95 and 12.39\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The anti-biofilm activity inhibited 64.43% and 60.89% of biofilm production. UA-AgNPs also impaired bacterial motility and caused higher protein and (Deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA leakage in membrane integrity assays compared to the control. Antioxidant activity was confirmed by DPPH and FRAP assays, and in vivo experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae highlighted significant antioxidant effects. Furthermore, UA-AgNPs exhibited potential anticancer activity against the HeLa cell line (IC<sub>50</sub> 29.20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) with minimal cytotoxicity on Vero cells (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.59\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). Moreover, UA-AgNPs reduced LPS-induced Nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells. Through molecular docking studies, they demonstrated interactions with breast cancer proteins BRCA1 and C-erbB2 and bacterial virulence proteins Hbl and aglD. These findings highlight the bio efficacy of UA-AgNPs as a dual-action therapeutic agent with potent antibacterial and anticancer activity, combined with low toxicity toward normal cells, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications.",

    "title": "Tumor-Associated Neutrophils and Desmoplastic Reaction in Breast Cancer Microenvironment: Association with Tumor Grade and Clinicopathological Features.",
    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of diverse immune and stromal cells, plays a key role in cancer progression. Among its components, tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and the desmoplastic reaction (DR) have emerged as important modulators of tumor behavior. While each has been extensively studied, their interrelationship and association with tumor grade and clinicopathological parameters remain unclear. This hypothesis-generating study aimed to explore the relationship between the presence of TANs, various types of DR, the grade of tumor malignancy, and other fundamental clinicopathological characteristics commonly studied in daily clinical practice. The study included a cohort of 65 cancer patients (N = 65). The average number of TANs was recorded. In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections, \"hot spots\" representing areas with the highest neutrophil density were first identified. The tumor-associated polymorphonuclear neutrophils were then counted in ten consecutive high-power fields (HPFs). In the same specimens, the DR was assessed and classified according to stromal texture. TANs did not follow a normal distribution across any clinicopathological category (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Significant differences in TAN levels were observed among DR types (Kruskal-Wallis H = 9.890, <i>p</i> = 0.007), with higher counts in myxoid compared to mature stroma (Mean Rank = 41.58 vs. 24.80, <i>p</i> = 0.006). TAN levels also varied significantly with tumor grade (H = 22.384, <i>p</i> < 0.001), increasing from Grade 1 to Grade 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.013-0.001). Higher TAN counts were associated with cellular erythroblastic oncogene B2 (c-erbB2) positivity (H = 6.547, <i>p</i> = 0.038), perineural invasion (Mann-Whitney U = 179.5, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and ER/PR negativity (<i>p</i> = 0.016 and <i>p</i> = 0.044, respectively). No significant association was found with necrosis (<i>p</i> = 0.083). A near-significant relationship was identified between DR type and tumor differentiation grade (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 9.448, <i>p</i> = 0.051), with mature stroma most common in Grade 1 tumors, keloid-like stroma in Grade 2, and myxoid stroma in Grade 3. High TAN levels were linked to aggressive tumor features and specific DR patterns. The association of myxoid stroma with elevated TAN infiltration may reflect a highly aggressive TME. These preliminary results warrant validation in larger, prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (THP) has been the standard first-line therapy for HER2+ advanced breast cancer for over a decade. With new regimens emerging, genomic tools like HER2DX may help identify patients who benefit durably from THP versus those requiring intensification. Here, baseline tumor tissue from 122 patients with HER2+ treated with THP in Poland was tested with HER2DX. A previously published Spanish real-world cohort (n\u2009=\u200993) was added to generate a combined cohort (n\u2009=\u2009215). Univariable analyses were performed in the Polish cohort, and multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were applied to the combined cohort. A HER2DX metastatic prognostic score was trained on overall survival (OS) in the Spanish cohort and validated in the Polish cohort. In the Polish cohort, high ERBB2 mRNA scores were associated with significantly longer real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) (33.8 vs. 17.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; p\u2009=\u20090.022) and real-world overall survival (rwOS) (75.1 vs. 40.2; HR 0.48; p\u2009=\u20090.009). In the combined cohort, ERBB2 high-score tumors showed prolonged rwPFS (33.8 vs. 12.5; HR 0.50; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and rwOS (not reached vs. 37.1; HR 0.36; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher rwORR (84.4% vs. 52.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Prognostic value was independent of clinical variables, including number of metastatic sites. Subgroup analyses showed particularly favorable outcomes in patients with <3 sites (median rwPFS 51.7 vs. 20.3 months). The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score outperformed ERBB2 alone in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA score provides independent prognostic information in HER2+ advanced breast cancer treated with THP. The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score further improves prognostic accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor type2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has emerged as a clinically relevant subtype with novel HER2-targeted therapies. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic implications of HER2-low status in patients with early breast cancer undergoing long-term follow-up. We retrospectively analyzed patients with HER2-negative early breast cancer who underwent surgery between 2003 and 2022. We investigated clinicopathological factors associated with HER2-low status and the clinical impacts of HER2-low/zero status on disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) according to hormone receptor (HR) status using univariate and multivariate analyses. Among 3663 patients with early breast cancer, we identified 2519 HER2-negative patients (HER2-low 57%, HER2-zero 28%). HER2-low status was associated with high estrogen-receptor (ER) positivity (Allred score 8) and less mucinous histology, but there was no association with progesterone receptor (PgR) expression. HER2-low status also tended to be associated with pre/perimenopausal status and higher nuclear grade (\u22652), but not with tumor size or lobular/metaplastic type. Pathological complete response rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were comparable between HER2-low (18.9%) and HER2-zero (21.6%), with no survival differences. HER2 status (low vs. zero) was not significantly associated with DFS, DDFS, or OS, and had no prognostic impact in patients with either HR-positive or -negative disease. HER2-low breast cancer was characterized by distinct biological features, including high ER positivity (especially Allred score 8) without PgR association, but did not confer a prognostic advantage over HER2-zero disease. HER2-low status may reflect biological heterogeneity that could be relevant when interpreting treatment response rather than serving as an independent prognostic marker.",

    "abstract": "HER2DX is a clinically available genomic assay that provides prognostic (relapse risk score), predictive [pathological complete response (pCR) likelihood score], and <i>ERBB2</i> expression data in stage I-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC). This real-world study evaluated its clinical impact. This prospective study enrolled newly diagnosed patients with stage I-III HER2-positive BC across 12 hospitals in Spain (November 2021-September 2024). Thirty-four oncologists ordered HER2DX and completed questionnaires before and after receiving results to assess treatment changes (primary objective). Secondary objectives included evaluating the HER2DX pCR likelihood score association with pCR, test turnaround time, changes in physician confidence regarding treatment decisions, and cost-effectiveness. Among 297 recruited patients, 48.1% (95% confidence interval 42.5% to 53.7%) experienced treatment adjustments after HER2DX. Within these cases, 73.5% involved reduced treatment intensity, 24.5% involved increased treatment intensity, and the remaining cases (2.0%) involved mixed adjustments. Of the cases with reduced treatment intensity, 56.2% had a reduction in chemotherapy intensity, 26.7% had a reduction in anti-HER2 therapy, and 17.1% in both. Among the 182 patients with available pathological data at surgery, the pCR likelihood score was a significant predictor of pCR (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In 69 patients with pCR-high disease, less intensive treatment achieved similar pCR rates compared with multi-agent chemotherapy (81.5% versus 69.0%; odds ratio = 1.97, <i>P</i> = 0.256). Physician confidence improved (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and the estimated total cost savings, including direct drug costs, vein access devices, and HER2DX costs, amounted to \u20ac98\u2009031. HER2DX impacts clinical management in stage I-III HER2-positive BC by supporting treatment adjustments, enhancing physician confidence, maintaining pCR rates, and reducing health care costs.",

    "abstract": "Since 2018, the TAILORx and RxPONDER trials have demonstrated that the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) can be indicative of the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer with 3 or fewer positive lymph nodes. However, its applicability to key subgroups with high risk for recurrence, including premenopausal women with positive lymph nodes and racial and ethnic minority individuals, remains unclear. To assess the temporal patterns of and disparities in adjuvant chemotherapy use in early-stage HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer by age, genomic risk, and nodal involvement. This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from the 2010 to 2022 National Cancer Database. The cohort included women with stage I to III, HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer who had undergone a lumpectomy or mastectomy and were eligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were categorized into premenopausal (aged \u226450 years) or postmenopausal (aged >50 years) status. Nodal status (negative or positive) was pathologically confirmed. RS was classified per the TAILORx trial, with RS of 0 to 10 as low genomic risk, RS of 11 to 25 as intermediate genomic risk, and RS of 26 or higher as high genomic risk. Data were analyzed from January 20 to August 11, 2025. Adjuvant systemic therapy, defined as receipt of either endocrine therapy alone or chemoendocrine therapy (chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy), after surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy). A total of 504\u202f937 women (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [10.7] years; 5.4% Hispanic, 4.3% non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 8.1% non-Hispanic Black, 81.3% non-Hispanic White, and 0.9% other race or ethnicity) were included. Among premenopausal patients with node-negative tumors, adjuvant chemotherapy use decreased from 6.5% in 2010 to 0.9% in 2022 for those with low genomic risk and from 29.6% in 2010 to 11.1% in 2022 for those with intermediate genomic risk. However, among premenopausal patients with node-positive disease, chemotherapy use declined from 33.3% in 2010 to 12.7% in 2019 but increased to 25.7% in 2022 for the low genomic risk group. For the intermediate genomic risk group, chemotherapy use declined from 55.8% in 2010 to 38.1% in 2019 but increased to 48.9% in 2022. Among postmenopausal women, chemotherapy use for those with low to intermediate genomic risk continued to decrease from 2010 to 2022 in both node-negative and node-positive disease status. Black women with high genomic risk had lower odds of chemotherapy receipt than White women, regardless of menopausal or nodal status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). Premenopausal Black women with low to intermediate genomic risk also had lower odds of chemotherapy receipt than White women (AOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94), regardless of nodal status. This retrospective cohort study found that adjuvant chemotherapy use almost doubled in premenopausal patients with node-positive tumors and with a low to intermediate genomic risk from 2019 to 2022 but decreased for patients with node-negative disease, coinciding with the publication of the TAILORx and RxPONDER trials. The findings highlight the variability in genomic assay use to facilitate adjuvant therapy recommendations for HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "CD151, a cell surface oncoprotein belongs to the tetraspanin family, drives metastasis, drug resistance, and immune escape, and is recognized as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). In the screening phase, a positive correlation between CD151 expression and amplification of CCND1, ERBB2, and MYC genes as well with breast cancer (BC) metastasis was observed using data from different GEO datasets. This study identified three immunogenic peptides within the large extracellular loop (LEL) of CD151 using in silico approaches: one each of CTL and HTL epitope, which bind strongly to class I and II MHC molecules, and one B-cell epitope, eliciting a robust IgG immune response. In the validation phase, a multiepitope was constructed by incorporating high immunogenic peptides and adjuvants, which showed significant antigenicity and broader population coverage. The results also showed a hierarchy in the binding of multiepitope with key immune receptor molecules, highlighting their potential in activating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation and normal mode analysis studies uncovered a strong interaction between the multiepitope construct and TLR2. The simulation of immune system activation by the multiepitope construct using the C-ImmSim web server showed a strong B- and T-cell response with potential activation of natural killer and dendritic cells. The results also showed active antigen internalization by macrophages, their presentation to other immune cells, and IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion. In addition, AntiCP web server predicted both CTL and HTL epitopes as anticancer peptides. The in vitro study validated that synthetic peptides corresponding to CD151-LEL-based CTL and HTL peptides induced cytotoxicity in BC cell lines MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7. They reduced the CCND1mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, while MYC mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. Also, they significantly induced the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 while reducing the secretion of IL-10. Furthermore, conditioned media from the treated BC cells induced the proliferation of PMA treated monocyte like THP-1 cells and provoked the secretion of IL-6, while reducing IL-10. These findings suggest that the CD151-LEL-based peptides and their engineered multiepitope construct represent a prospective vaccine candidate for in vivo experimental validation, which can be used as a therapeutic vaccine for breast cancer.",

The use of aromatase inhibitors in the preoperative hormone response test is accompanied by statistically significant changes in the mRNA expression of 37 genes in breast tumors, of which a decrease in the expression level was found for 35 genes (<i>ESR1, PGR, AR, ERBB2, FGFR4, MKI67, MYBL2, CCNB1, AURKA, BIRC5, CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A, KIF14, PPP2R2A, PTTG1, TMEM45B, TPX2, ANLN, MMP11, CTSL2, EMSY, PAK1, BCL2, BAG1, PTEN, TYMS, EXO1, UBE2T, NAT1, SCGB2A2, GATA3, FOXA1, ZNF703, CD274/PD-L1</i>), an increase - for two genes (<i>SFRP1, KRT5</i>).

Comparative mRNA expression analysis confirms that a short preoperative course of aromatase inhibitors induces a more potent and uniform molecular response, characterized by profound suppression of proliferation and complete inhibition of estrogen-dependent signaling. Tamoxifen therapy is also effective but results in less pronounced suppression of key targets and, crucially, may be accompanied by early activation of the <i>MYC</i> oncogene, a potential marker for resistance development.",

We identified 153 IBC cases in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (total N\u2009=\u20094,739). RNA expression was measured on the NanoString platform (N\u2009=\u200974 IBC, 2,696 non-IBC) and used to determine molecular subtypes, including PAM50, immune, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and P53 status. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of associations between IBC and patient demographic, molecular, and social characteristics using logistic regression, and compared differences in gene expression using ANOVA. Women with IBC were associated with Black and under 50 compared to non-IBC. IBC was associated with rural address (OR\u2009=\u20091.53) and poverty (OR\u2009=\u20091.61). Molecularly, IBC was associated with HER2-enriched (OR\u2009=\u20096.14), Luminal B (OR\u2009=\u20092.90), P53 Mutant-like (OR\u2009=\u20091.79), and high HRD (OR\u2009=\u20091.90).

Only six of 219 genes measured were significantly differentially expressed between IBC and non-IBC, including HER2-related (ERBB2, FGFR4, GRB7) and P53-related genes (BTG2, LOC400043, MAP2K4). Although not associated with immune subtypes, IBC showed differences in HER2 and P53 pathways.

    "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal known to act as an endocrine disruptor, has been implicated in breast cancer (BC) via mechanisms that involve both estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and -independent pathways. We used BALB-neuT transgenic mice, a model of aggressive ErbB2-driven mammary carcinogenesis, to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to an environmentally relevant, low-dose of Cd on tumor onset, multiplicity, progression, immune microenvironment, and metastasis. Cd exposure significantly accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor multiplicity and weight, reducing both tumor-free and overall survival. Cd-exposed mice displayed elevated serum estrogen levels, and increased expression of progesterone receptor and tumor progression markers, including CD31, Ki67, and phosphorylated Akt, in tumor tissues. Despite the increased recruitment of CD4\u207a and CD8\u207a T cells to the peritumoral stroma, Cd exposure fostered an immunosuppressive microenvironment with elevated Tregs and PD-1\u207a exhausted T cells, both locally and systemically. Notably, lung metastases were threefold more frequent in Cd-exposed mice. Our results demonstrate that low-dose Cd exposure promotes the development and progression of ErbB2-driven breast tumors through hormonal, proliferative, and immune-modulating mechanisms. These findings reveal that exposure to environmentally relevant doses of Cd not only accelerates ErbB2-driven breast cancer but also reshapes the immune landscape toward dysfunction and immunosuppression, likely compromising both anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapies. These data advocate for tighter regulation of Cd exposure in populations at risk for breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer presents substantial molecular heterogeneity, requiring accurate subtype classification, receptor-status prediction, and survival estimation for precision care. Existing machine-learning models often fail to generalize across cohorts or adapt to rare subtypes. We propose a unified graph neural network (GNN) framework that integrates multi-task learning, domain-adversarial adaptation, contrastive self-supervision, few-shot meta-learning, and generative augmentation. Gene-expression data from TCGA-BRCA (1084 samples) and METABRIC (1980 samples) were mapped onto gene-centric PPI graphs and patient-similarity graphs. A shared encoder (including Graph Transformer variants) jointly predicts intrinsic subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like), ER/PR/HER2 biomarkers, and overall survival (OS) using a Cox proportional hazards head. Validation included fivefold cross-validation and strict TCGA\u2009\u2192\u2009METABRIC transfer testing. The multi-task Graph Transformer achieved subtype F1\u2009=\u20090.872, ER/PR/HER2 AUCs of 0.960/0.943/0.918, and C-index\u2009=\u20090.721. Domain adaptation improved external subtype F1 from 0.738 to 0.801. For the HER2-enriched subtype, MAML enabled few-shot prediction with F1\u2009=\u20090.782, while MolGAN augmentation increased HER2 AUC to 0.935. GNNExplainer highlighted biologically consistent drivers, including ESR1, ERBB2, and PGR, aligning with known hormonal and HER2 signaling mechanisms. This study introduces a comprehensive, interpretable GNN framework that unifies subtyping, biomarker prediction, and survival modeling while improving cross-cohort robustness and rare-subtype adaptation. The combination of multi-task learning, domain adaptation, self-supervision, and generative augmentation demonstrates strong potential for clinically actionable decision support.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is known to be a disease of altered cellular signaling; however, the relationship between mutation-specific changes to signal transduction and the phenotypic consequences produced remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate two common breast cancer driver mutations, the <i>PIK3CA</i><sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> mutation and the <i>ErbB2</i> amplification, both of which activate the PI3K-Akt pathway but paradoxically drive distinct cellular outcomes. Indeed, in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells, PI3K<sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> expression induced features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while ErbB2<sup><i>amp</i></sup> cells exhibited a hyperproliferative phenotype. Characterization of PI3K axis signaling revealed that ErbB2<sup><i>amp</i></sup> cells display prolonged, stimulus-dependent PI3K activation, whereas PI3K<sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> cells show constitutive, ligand-independent signaling. To test whether these distinct dynamics contribute to the phenotypic responses, we employed an iLID-based optogenetic system that enables precise, tunable control of endogenous PI3K activity. Using this tool to mimic the mutation-specific dynamics in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, we found that PI3K signaling patterns alone were sufficient to reproduce key features of the <i>PIK3CA H1047R</i>-associated EMT phenotype but not the <i>ErbB2</i>-associated proliferative phenotype. These findings suggest that the temporal encoding of pathway activity, not merely its magnitude, can drive some phenotypic changes in oncogenic progression, explain how distinct mutations within a common signaling pathway can produce divergent cellular phenotypes, and provide a workflow for interrogating the functional consequences of changes in signaling dynamics.",

This study aimed to investigate clinicopathologic and somatic alterations in breast tumors stratified by HER2 status. Ninety breast cancer patients were stratified by HER2 expression (1+, 2+, 3+) using immunohistochemistry and confirmed by FISH. For each patient, paired diagnostic biopsies and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) residual tumors were analyzed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 34 paired samples, and shortlisted variants were validated by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) in 90 cases. Among the 90 paired samples, 40 were HER2-high, and 50 were HER2-low/TNBC. HER2-high tumors presented with a larger mean size (3.34\u00a0cm vs. 2.29\u00a0cm) but lower lymph-node metastasis (40% vs. 60%) compared to HER2-low/TNBC. NGS identified frequent mutations in PIK3CA (24%), TP53 (32%), and ERBB2 (9%). PIK3CA variants His1047Arg and Glu542Lys exhibited significantly higher variant allele frequencies in post-NACT tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.05). HER2-high tumors demonstrated a greater prevalence of ERBB2 mutations (13.5%), whereas in HER2-low patients, such mutations appeared only after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Importantly, PIK3CA mutations were correlated with increased lymph-node metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and poorer survival outcomes, underscoring their prognostic impact. HER2-high and HER2-low/TNBC breast cancers demonstrate distinct clinicopathologic and molecular profiles. Therapy-associated enrichment of PIK3CA mutations and their association with aggressive behavior underscore their prognostic and therapeutic significance in HER2-positive disease. Further studies are needed to clarify their role in guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Targeted next-generation sequencing reveals genomic differences between male and female breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Compared with female breast cancer (FBC), male breast cancer (MBC) is often detected at the advanced stage and has a poorer prognosis. Due to the limited research data on MBC, its clinical diagnosis and treatment regimens are mainly based on FBC, although these regimens may not be appropriate for MBC patients. This study aimed to investigate the similarities and differences between MBC and FBC at the genetic level, in order to provide ideas and basis for the diagnosis and treatment of MBC. In this cross-sectional study, we conducted high-throughput sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples obtained from a cohort of 12 MBC and 14 FBC patients. Utilizing bioinformatics tools, we meticulously analyzed and compared the genomic profiles to elucidate the underlying genetic distinctions between MBC and FBC. In our study, <i>MLL3</i> and <i>GATA3</i> mutations were most prevalent in MBC while <i>TP53</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>MLL3</i> mutations dominated in FBC. Notably, certain genes exhibited shared point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across genders. The mutation prevalence of <i>PIK3CA</i> was significantly different between MBC and FBC. <i>CDK12</i> and <i>ERBB2</i> had the highest prevalence of CNV in FBC, contrasting with their absence in MBC. Both in MBC and FBC, <i>MYC</i> had the highest prevalence in CNV. Furthermore, FBC demonstrated a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) than MBC. MBC private genes were involved in a variety of disease-related signaling pathways, with the ErbB and PI3K-Akt pathways being significantly enriched. We concluded that MBC and FBC exhibit both genomic similarities and distinctions in our study. In the context of precision medicine, this study may provide new ideas and a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of MBC.",

    "title": "Cardioprotective Role of Neuregulin1-ErbB2 Signaling Pathway: Its Physiological and Onco-Cardiological Roles in the Heart.",
    "abstract": "Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, regulates the development, differentiation, proliferation, and plasticity in multiple tissues through its binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors. In the cardiovascular system, NRG1 plays a crucial role in cardiac development, physiological function, and cell survival. Since NRG1 exerts cardioprotective effects through its interaction with ErbB2/ErbB4 and ErbB4 homodimers on cardiomyocytes, the administration of recombinant human NRG1 has the potential for the treatment of heart failure. ErbB2 is known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is overexpressed in approximately 20% of breast cancers. Trastuzumab (TRZ), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting ErbB2/HER2, is used for the therapy of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, cardiotoxicity has been observed in approximately 5-10% of patients treated with TRZ. Risk factors for the onset of cardiotoxicity include the use of anthracyclines, hypertension, and diabetes. However, the mechanism linking diabetes and TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear. Recently, we reported that the serum levels of NRG1 were elevated in the mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that the up-regulated NRG1 compensates for insulin deficiency to maintain systolic function in the early stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This review aims to discuss the physiological roles of NRG1-ErbB2 signaling in the cardiovascular system, the cardioprotective effects of NRG1 and its clinical applications, and the molecular mechanisms of TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity through the blockade of the NRG1-ErbB2 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Tougu Xiaotong Capsule (TXC), a traditional formulation used for osteoarthritis, comprises Sarcandra glabra, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Paeonia lactiflora, and Morinda officinalis. Since these constituents exhibit antitumor activity, we hypothesized that TXC could combat drug resistance through multiple mechanisms, including ferroptosis and erythroblastic oncogene B2\u200c (ERBB2) signaling. This study investigated the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of TXC in treating lung cancer, specifically in the context of gefitinib resistance. This study employed an integrated pharmacological approach combining phytochemical profiling, in vitro phenotypic and mechanistic assays on gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant lung cancer cells, proteomic analysis for target identification, and in vivo validation using a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse model. The chemical profile of TXC was characterized via ultra-performance liquid chromatography\u2012tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC\u2012MS/MS). In vitro assays were used to evaluate the antiproliferative, apoptotic, and antimigratory effects of TXC and its constituents on lung and breast cancer cell lines, including gefitinib-resistant cells. High-performance liquid chromatography-MS (HPLC-MS)-based proteomic analysis identified potential targets, subsequently validating the ability of TXC to modulate the ERBB2/PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and ferroptosis through Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/lipid peroxidation (LPO) assessment. Finally, a subcutaneous LLC mouse model confirmed the in vivo antitumor efficacy and safety profile of TXC, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent. TXC had stronger inhibitory effects on lung cancer cells than did its components. In vitro, it reduced viability and proliferation in lung and breast cancer cells, induced cycle arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells, and inhibited migration. Proteomics revealed ERBB2 downregulation and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) upregulation. TXC suppressed the ERBB2/PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and induced ferroptosis via HMOX1 upregulation and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) downregulation, causing iron accumulation, LPO, and ROS elevation. In vivo, oral TXC inhibited tumor growth in LLC mice via similar mechanisms. It also suppressed gefitinib resistance in cells and synergized with gefitinib. TXC combats lung cancer by blocking ERBB2/PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling and triggering ferroptosis through HMOX1/GPX4 modulation, overcoming gefitinib resistance. This study elucidates a novel dual mechanism of action of TXC against lung cancer, particularly gefitinib-resistant phenotypes, characterized by the inhibition of the ERBB2/PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis and the simultaneous induction of ferroptosis. These findings provide evidence supporting the potential utility of TXC as an adjuvant therapy to circumvent gefitinib resistance in clinical oncology.",

    "abstract": "Selective gene delivery to defined cell populations remains one of the key challenges in lentiviral vector-based gene therapy. The vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) confers high infectivity but lacks cell-type specificity because of the ubiquitous expression of its receptor, LDLR. To enable modular, receptor-specific targeting while retaining the production efficiency of VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors, we designed a bispecific adapter, 929-B6, comprising a VSV-G-binding nanobody and an ERBB2-binding DARPin 9.29. Anti-VSV-G nanobodies were isolated from an alpaca immune library and screened in cell-based pseudoreceptor assays to identify the optimal binder (VSVG-B6). The resulting adapter was evaluated with receptor-ablated (VSV-G<sub>mut</sub>) and wild-type VSV-G-pseudotyped LVs across ERBB2-positive and -negative cell lines and in a mouse xenograft model. 929-B6 enabled efficient, receptor-specific transduction of ERBB2-expressing cells without increasing infection of ERBB2-negative controls. Pre-incubation of VSV-G<sub>mut</sub>-pseudotyped LVs with 1-2 \u00b5g/mL 929-B6 increased transduction up to eight-fold in ERBB2<sup>+</sup> cells, with similar but smaller effects for VSV-G and VSV-G<sub>mut</sub> + 929R pseudotypes. Across breast cancer lines, transduction enhancement correlated with ERBB2 surface density, and co-culture experiments confirmed selective entry into ERBB2<sup>+</sup> populations. In vivo imaging of ERBB2<sup>+</sup> tumors revealed a visible tumor-localized luminescent signal following administration of 929-B6-treated vectors. The 929-B6 adapter provides a rapid, scalable means to retarget standard LV stocks toward chosen receptors without re-engineering the envelope or co-packaging pseudoreceptor plasmids. Its modularity suggests a generalizable platform for both gene therapy and oncolytic applications requiring flexible, receptor-defined tropism.",

    "abstract": "The cHER2+ breast cancer subtype is characterized by the overexpression of the HER2 oncoprotein based on immunohistochemistry (IHC)/or by <i>ERBB2</i> gene amplification using in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. Targeted therapies are significantly changing cancer treatment outcomes. However, not all patients benefit from it due to misclassification or intrinsic mechanisms of resistance. Identifying predictive factors of response to therapy is thus crucial for optimizing treatment protocol. In addition, with the development of effective antibody-drug conjugates for targeting HER2-low subtypes, enhancing the HER2 molecular classification is crucial. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of publicly available datasets (TCGA, METABRIC, I-SPY, NOAH and CHER-LOB trials) has been considered. We present a metagene expression score (HER2MtGx 31-gene assay) based on the most informative genes associated with each molecular profile. HER2MtGx scores represent three linear subspaces associated with the HER2, Luminal and Basal-like profiles (STAT). In the METABRIC cohort, the scores are useful to discriminate against the HER2-enriched phenotype and this classification is significantly associated with long-term survival in cHER2+ patients (HR = 1.76; 95%CI = 1.09-2.86). In terms of response to neoadjuvant chemo/target therapy including I-SPY, NOAH, and CHER-LOB trials, the metagene scores are associated with the pathological response to therapy (OR = 2.26; 95%CI = 1.74-2.98).

HER2-positive breast cancers (BCa) account for 15-30% of BCa cases and benefit from HER2-targeted therapies, yet predictive in vitro models remain limited. To generate and compare 3D spheroids from two HER2+ BCa cell lines, SKBR3 and BT474, and investigate how 3D architecture influences HER2 distribution, intracellular signaling, and cellular organization. Spheroids were reproducibly generated from SKBR3 and BT474 cells and analyzed after 4 days of culture. Cell viability was evaluated using live/dead staining, HER2 distribution was assessed by confocal microscopy and quantified on cryosections, and protein expression/phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting. Epithelial and EMT markers were visualized by immunofluorescence, and ultrastructural features were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both cell lines formed viable spheroids with distinct architectures: SKBR3 spheroids were loose and heterogeneous, whereas BT474 spheroids were compact and highly spherical. Confocal and cryosection imaging showed consistent membrane HER2 localization with a progressive signal decrease toward the core of the spheroids, more pronounced in BT474. Western blotting revealed divergent HER2 expression and AKT phosphorylation: SKBR3 spheroids displayed increased HER2 but reduced pAKT, while BT474 spheroids showed reduced HER2 and pAKT levels. EpCAM and E-cadherin staining revealed cell line-specific epithelial organization, and TEM demonstrated differences in intercellular spacing and mitochondrial morphology, reflecting spheroid compactness. 3D architecture profoundly influences HER2 distribution, signaling, and structural organization in HER2+ BCa spheroids. This model provides a robust platform for investigating architecture-dependent molecular processes, with potential applications in drug response, receptor trafficking, and targeted therapy evaluation.",

However, limited clinical data and efficacy biomarkers for TCbHP have been reported in Chinese HER2-positive breast cancer patients. This study aimed to observe the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in the cohort, with an exploratory analysis of efficacy-related biomarkers in a subset of patients. This was a prospective, observational, non-interventional cohort study. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with TCbHP neoadjuvant therapy were prospectively collected. Exploratory genomic and transcriptomic biomarker analyses were performed in a subset of patients with available baseline tumour specimens retrospectively collected. A total of 252 patients with a median age of 48\u2009years were enrolled. Patients with stage III were 69.4% (175/252), and clinical N3 patients accounted for 24.6% (62/252). Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive were 62.7% (158/252). Total pCR rate was 55.2% (139/252). HR-negative and HR-positive rates were 72.3% (68/94) and 44.9% (71/158), respectively. Among neoadjuvant taxanes, including paclitaxel, docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, the pCR rates were 50.0% (57/114), 50.0% (41/82), and 73.2% (41/56), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that HR negativity, receiving nab-paclitaxel, HER2 3+, and cT1-2 were independent predictive factors of high pCR. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on baseline tumour specimens from 40 patients. Genomic analysis revealed lower pCR rates in patients with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (odds ratio\u2009=\u200913.47, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.025) and <i>SPOP</i> amplification (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.047) than in wild types.

    "abstract": "Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressed breast cancer (BC) represents the more aggressive subtype of HR\u2009+\u2009BC, typically associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite significant advancements in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC, resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) poses a continued challenge. Imlunestrant is a next-generation, oral, brain-penetrant, pure antagonistic ER degrader designed to deliver continuous ER target inhibition. It has shown favorable clinical benefit, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) when used as monotherapy or with targeted therapy in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced BC (ABC). Here, we present the safety and efficacy of imlunestrant with HER2 targeted therapy in patients with ER+/HER2\u2009+\u2009ABC of the EMBER trial. Patients were randomized to imlunestrant (400\u00a0mg RP2D)\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab (group A) versus imlunestrant\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab\u2009\u00b1\u2009abemaciclib [(150\u00a0mg twice daily) group B] or received maintenance treatment with imlunestrant\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab\u2009+\u2009pertuzumab until progression or discontinuation at standard doses (group C). In the randomized allocation, eligible patients with locally advanced or metastastic disease had received\u2009\u2265\u20092 prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting, and no prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors or fulvestrant. The maintenance cohort (group C) was added later to include patients without disease progression after first-line induction taxane-based chemotherapy (any duration), trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. Endpoints included safety, PK, antitumor activity, and tumor biomarker assessments. In total, 45 patients with ER+/HER2\u2009+\u2009ABC were treated (group A, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200918; group B, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200921; group C, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096). Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of the partner drugs. Imlunestrant PK was consistent with previously reported data. For groups A, B, and C, the objective response rates (ORRs) were 7%, 25%, and 33%, respectively, while the clinical benefit rates (CBRs) were 44%, 48%, and 100%. In group C, the duration of response ranged between 5.13 and 9.46 months. In groups A and B, baseline plasma ctDNA sample sequencing identified prevalent alterations in <i>ERBB2</i> amplification (57%), <i>CCND1</i> amplification (22%), and mutations in <i>TP53</i> (49%), <i>PIK3CA</i> (30%), <i>ESR1</i> (24%), and <i>GATA3</i> (14%).

    "abstract": "Treatment of HER2 positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer has significantly improved since the development of trastuzumab. However, approximately 30\u00a0% of patients develop trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) manifested as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with nearly 5\u00a0% of cases progressing to congestive heart failure. While TIC is generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation, the underlying mechanisms of this adverse reaction remain incompletely understood. Emerging evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to individual susceptibility. The variant rs1136201 in the ERBB2 gene, also known as HER2 Ile655Val or I655V, has been studied for its association with TIC, yet its role remains controversial. This study investigates the implication of the rs1136201 variant in cardiotoxicity in in vitro models of human cardiomyocytes exposed to trastuzumab. We generated AC16 ventricular cardiomyocyte cell models representing the three genotypes of the rs1136201 variant and performed transcriptomic analysis following trastuzumab exposure. Furthermore, we established a second model consisting of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients carrying the rs1136201 variant and controls and evaluated the impact of this variant on mitochondrial function and contractility after trastuzumab treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alteration of the electron transport chain, ATP synthesis, cellular respiration, and ribosome biogenesis in cells carrying the rs1136201 variant after trastuzumab exposure. hiPSC-CMs showed a reduction in upstroke (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0107) and downstroke velocities (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0117) compared to controls.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of clinical, genomic, and immune correlates of T-DXd outcomes to identify molecular determinants of therapeutic benefit and resistance. We retrospectively analyzed 2 independent cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with T-DXd at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Yale Cancer Center between 2018 and 2024. We included patients with \u22652 tumor blocks with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessments prior to T-DXd. Clinical data on 524 patients were manually reviewed, and genomic profiling and immune microenvironment assessments were performed on a subset of patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between molecular features and overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT). Among 524 patients, HER2 IHC discordance between sequential tumor biopsies was observed in 20% of patients and was independently associated with significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.67; P\u2009=\u2009.012) and TTNT (HR\u2009=\u20090.65; P\u2009=\u2009.002), resembling outcomes seen in HER2 0 tumors.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, with a strikingly high incidence in Egypt, particularly in familial cases. This study aims to comprehensively elucidate the pathological and molecular significance of ERBB2 (HER2/neu) overexpression in Egyptian familial breast cancer, highlighting its role in tumor aggressiveness, immune evasion, and precision oncology. We enrolled 44 Egyptian breast cancer patients along with 35 daughters and 24 sisters (2013-2015, Mansoura University Hospital). Comprehensive analyses included serum biochemical assays, histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemical staining for ERBB2, and molecular detection of ERBB2 amplification using first-round and nested PCR. Associations with clinical, hormonal, and metabolic variables were also explored. Serum biochemical profiling revealed significantly elevated ALT (6.6\u00b10.55 U/mL), LDH (16.8\u00b11.4 U/mL), and CA15 3 (160\u00b113.33 U/mL), with reduced AST (2.6\u00b10.22 U/mL) compared to controls (<i>P</i>\u22640.05). Histopathology confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma with dense stromal desmoplasia. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ERBB2 overexpression in>10% of tumor cells. Nested PCR detected ERBB2 amplification in 72% of patients, and in daughters (17%) and sisters (20%). Notably, higher ERBB2 expression was observed in unmarried patients (100%), pre-menopausal women (73-72%), and those with diabetes or hypertension, suggesting hormonal and metabolic modulation via PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. ERBB2 mutations were identified in 14% of patients, 2.1% of daughters, and 1.2% of sisters. Furthermore, ERBB2 may upregulate PD-L1, contributing to immune evasion. Our findings highlight ERBB2 as a pivotal diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in Egyptian familial breast cancer and support integrating HER2-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and metabolic interventions. This approach could transform outcomes in high-risk familial cohorts. The study emphasizes the importance of genetic screening and precision medicine strategies that consider molecular, hormonal, and metabolic contexts in breast cancer care.",

Abemaciclib was linked to higher risk of death in those aged 65-85 compared to younger adults (OR 1.53; 95\u00a0% CI 1.18-1.99), but lower odds of myelosuppression (OR 0.37; 95\u00a0% CI 0.26-0.53). Palbociclib showed similar death risk across age groups (OR 0.98; 95\u00a0% CI 0.92-1.05) and reduced risk of disease progression in older adults (OR 0.72; 95\u00a0% CI 0.61-0.84). Ribociclib showed no significant age-related difference in fatality (OR 1.01; 95\u00a0% CI 0.87-1.17) but had the highest overall death risk (OR 9.14 vs palbociclib; 95\u00a0% CI 7.70-10.84). Real-world data reveal drug- and age-specific toxicity differences. Ribociclib and abemaciclib pose higher risks in older adults compared to palbociclib, supporting the need for personalized treatment and careful monitoring in older patients.",

    "title": "Cognitive Impairment and Chemoendocrine vs Endocrine Therapy in Pre- and Postmenopausal Women: A Secondary Analysis of the RxPONDER Randomized Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer treatment is associated with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). However, the association of endocrine therapy (ET) vs chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy (CET) with CRCI is poorly understood. To compare patient-reported CRCI between women with breast cancer treated with ET vs CET and to consider whether menopausal status may be associated. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of RxPONDER (SWOG S1007), a multinational phase 3 randomized clinical trial of more than 5000 women with hormone receptor-positive ERBB2-negative (formerly HER2-negative) breast cancer with 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes and Oncotype DX (21-gene recurrence score) of 25 or less. Participants were enrolled from February 2011 to September 2017, with results first reported in December 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to CET or ET, with ongoing follow-up. This secondary analysis assessed cognitive function using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Perceived Cognitive Function Concerns (PCF) questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12, and 36 months. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to August 2025. Random assignment to CET or ET. Mean PCF standardized (T) scores by menopausal status over time using generalized estimating equations analysis for continuous outcomes. Of the 568 patients who completed the baseline questionnaire and were included in the analysis, 139 (24%) were premenopausal (median [range] age, 47.8 [28.0-56.3] years) and 429 (76%) were postmenopausal (median [range] age, 62.3 [37.3-87.6] years). Among the 274 (48%) who received CET and the 294 (52%) who received ET alone, CET was determined to have a greater negative association with patient-reported CRCI in both the pre- and postmenopausal participants during the 36-month follow-up. In the ET alone group, PCF scores for premenopausal participants decreased from baseline to 6 and 12 months (53.53, 51.51, and 51.72, respectively) but recovered to baseline (54.36) at 36 months. For postmenopausal participants, mean PCF scores were essentially stable (51.72, 51.13, 51.11, and 51.70, respectively); however, in the CET group, PCF scores for both pre- and postmenopausal participants decreased from baseline to 6 and 12 months (premenopausal, 52.84, 49.27, 48.04; postmenopausal, 50.65, 48.39, 47.13, respectively) and did not return to baseline at 36 months (premenopausal, 49.25; postmenopausal, 48.44). The difference in longitudinal mean PCF scores over time between CET and ET groups was -3.02 (95% CI, -5.33 to -0.72; P\u2009=\u2009.01) for premenopausal and -2.37 (95% CI, -3.92 to -0.82; P\u2009=\u2009.003) for postmenopausal participants. This secondary analysis of the RxPONDER found that CET had a greater negative association with patient-reported CRCI compared to ET alone in both pre- and postmenopausal participants over a 36-month follow-up period. Interventions to prevent or treat CRCI are needed to improve the long-term quality of life of these patients treated with chemotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01272037.",

    "abstract": "KN026 is a novel bispecific HER2-targeting antibody for HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that showed prolonged median PFS and lessened distinction of PFS regarding the HR subgroup in our phase II clinical trial, compared with PUFFIN study of first-line trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab therapy. A more detailed discovery of its peculiarity is needed for optimal application of KN026 treatment. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of digital spatial profiling (DSP) on 8 pre/post-treatment tumor samples. Mechanistic explorations were conducted by plasmid transfection, co-culture, CCK8 proliferation assay and flow cytometry. Compared to the tumor regions with non-objective response (OR), those with OR had high expression of CALML5, TFAP2B, and ERBB2, and relatively low expression of ESR1 in tumor cells at baseline. The expression of ESR1 had a tentative association with PI3K/AKT and NOTCH signaling pathways which were downstream or interactive pathways of HER2 target and also acted as interactive pathways of ER-mediated signaling. The co-expression of ERBB2 and CDK12 emerged as a distinctive signature of OR. KN026 treatment also reshaped intratumoral activated T- and B-cell subtypes in hot-tumor regions, regardless of myeloid-derived cells. Both HER2 and ESR1 are determinant of KN026 efficacy in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, implying the potential of KN026 combined with endocrine therapy in HER2- and ER-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Molecular analysis of actionable driver mutations and somatic copy number alterations (sCNAs) in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is increasingly being used to guide personalised medicine in patients with cancer. In previous CTC studies, high numbers of CTCs were needed for successful recovery of individual CTCs for molecular analysis at a time when patients typically have very short survival, limiting clinical applicability. Here, by performing longitudinal analyses of ctDNA and CTCs across a broad range of CTC counts, we hypothesized that CTCs could reveal synergistic and additional genomic information to ctDNA at points when therapeutic interventions could be considered in the follow up of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Eight patients underwent serial blood sampling. CTCs were captured via CellSearch-DEPArray from 7.5\u00a0mL (CellSave tubes), while 15\u00a0mL (EDTA tubes) was used for cfDNA extraction. A total of 58 cfDNA samples and 192 CTCs from the 8 patients were compared by shallow whole genome sequencing sWGS and targeted next generation sequencing using custom designed mutation panels (cfDNA; dual barcoding Ion AmpliSeq HD technology (556 hotspots across 24 genes) and CTCs; SingleSeq-compatible AmpliSeq technology across 539 of the 556 (97%) hotspots). The majority of patient samples showed complementary genomic information in CTCs and ctDNA from the same blood sample. However, genome changes were detected in CTCs from some blood samples that were ctDNA negative despite progression providing actionable information at times when ctDNA analysis was not informative. Across the CTCs and ctDNA, common regions of loss included chromosome 13q14 containing the RB1 gene, detected in 3 of 4 patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors and amplification of 17q12 containing the ERBB2 gene in 2 of the 7 patients with HER2 negative metastatic disease, suggesting evolution to HER2 positive disease. Our study shows that CTCs provide key information that would have been missed by ctDNA monitoring alone and extends CTC and cfDNA genomic profiling to patients with a broad range of CTC counts for blood-based monitoring of HER2 status and other clinically actionable targets for informing treatment decisions in metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "Alpelisib, a selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor that targets PIK3CA mutations, is approved for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. However, its therapeutic potential in HER2-positive disease remains underexplored. Hyperglycemia, a frequent adverse event of alpelisib, limits its clinical application. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug with reported anticancer activity, may counteract alpelisib-induced hyperglycemia while enhancing its antitumor efficacy. We evaluated the effects of alpelisib alone and in combination with metformin in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and BT-474. Cell viability, colony formation, and tumorsphere assays were performed to assess proliferation and stemness. Flow cytometry was used to analyze ALDH1-positive cell populations and cell-cycle distribution. Synergy was determined using the combination index method. Western blotting examined the effects on signaling pathways and stemness-associated proteins. Alpelisib monotherapy inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and cancer stem cell features in both cell lines. Metformin enhanced these effects, demonstrating strong synergism. Combination treatment induced significant G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, reduced ALDH1\u207a populations, and decreased tumorsphere formation. Mechanistically, co-treatment broadly suppressed receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling, augmenting inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT pathways, along with downregulation of c-Myc. Stemness-related proteins including \u03b2-catenin, Nanog, Sox2, KLF4, and LGR5 were also markedly reduced. These findings indicate that metformin synergistically enhances the antitumor activity of alpelisib in HER2-positive breast cancer by inhibiting oncogenic signaling and stemness pathways. Beyond its metabolic benefit in mitigating hyperglycemia, metformin may potentiate PI3K-targeted therapies, supporting further preclinical and clinical evaluation of this combination strategy.",

    "abstract": "HER2DX is a validated genomic assay used to support treatment decisions in early-stage HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. It provides three scores: relapse risk, likelihood of pathologic complete response (pCR), and ERBB2 mRNA expression. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HER2DX and histopathologic features and assess its relationship with pCR after neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed stage I to III HER2+ breast cancer were analyzed based on available HER2DX results during routine care in Spain (January 2022-June 2025). Centralized HER2DX testing was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Histopathologic analysis included tumor grade, hormone receptor status, histologic subtype, Ki67 index, HER2 IHC score, stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), tertiary lymphoid structures, and spatial immune distribution. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with pCR after neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. A total of 410 HER2+ tumors were analyzed, and 250 patients received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy with available surgical outcomes (36% achieved a pCR). HER2DX pCR scores were significantly associated with all eight histopathologic features, whereas relapse risk and ERBB2 scores were associated with five and two, respectively. TIL correlated with the immune/immunoglobulin signature (r = 0.59), and Ki67 with the proliferation signature (r = 0.50). The HER2DX pCR score remained the only independent predictor of pCR in multivariable analysis (OR, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.97; P = 0.030). HER2DX reflects key biological and pathologic features of HER2+ breast cancer and independently predicts pCR, supporting its utility for individualized treatment decision-making.",

    "abstract": "DOT1L, a histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, is a potential therapeutic target in various malignancies. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the anti-tumor effect of DOT1L inhibition in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer cells (MCF7) and ER-negative/HER2-positive cells (SKBR3) were treated with a DOT1L inhibitor (SGC0946, EPZ-5676), after which colony formation assays, cell cycle assays, flow cytometry, gene expression microarray analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) were performed. Genetic ablation of STING was performed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Treatment with a DOT1L inhibitor suppressed proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both ER-positive/HER2-negative and ER-negative/HER2-positive cells. Transcriptome and epigenome analysis revealed that DOT1L inhibition activated transcription of a number of interferon (IFN)-related genes (IRGs) in breast cancer cells. We also found that DOT1L inhibition upregulated type I and type III IFNs as well as cell surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression. Notably, DOT1L inhibition induced DNA damage and upregulated levels of cytoplasmic DNA in breast cancer cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of STING in breast cancer cells significantly suppressed the IFN signaling activated by DOT1L inhibition and attenuated the anti-tumor effect. Moreover, scATAC-seq analysis revealed that DOT1L inhibition suppressed expression of ERBB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that the anti-breast cancer effect of DOT1L inhibition is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including activation of innate immune signaling.",

    "abstract": "The overexpression and homodimerization of ErbB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer are key regulators of oncogenic signaling cascades; however, effective pharmacological disruption of this pathway remains a formidable therapeutic challenge. ErbB2 homodimerization promotes autophosphorylation in breast cancer, leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways. Despite advances in chemotherapy, current treatments have not been effective in blocking ErbB2 homodimerization. This study explores the potential of natural phytochemicals from Ocimum sanctum (OS) leaves to disrupt ErbB2 dimerization and its downstream signaling in HER2-positive breast cancer. We analyzed the ethanolic extract of OS using the GC-MS technique and performed several in silico assessments, such as pharmacokinetic prediction, drug-likeness properties, ADMET evaluation, gene expression analysis of the target protein, molecular docking, DFT analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. Post-simulation analyses, including PCA, DCCM, and FEL, were performed for validation. A total of 78 compounds were identified from the ethanolic extract of OS. The compound N-Carbobenzoxy-L-Phenylalanine (N-CBZ-L-Phenylalanine) showed promising inhibitory activity compared to the other compounds. C13 showed a potential docking score of -8.5\u00a0kcal/mol, and three amino acid residues (VAL-3, TYR281, and HIS468) were tightly bound (hydrogen bond) to the ErbB2 (PDB ID: 3WLW) protein, stabilizing the complex (3WLW-C13). Based on the DFT analysis, C13 exhibited the most favorable thermodynamic properties, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, and electrostatic characteristics. Compared to the reference endocrine therapy D1 (letrozole), C13 exhibited superior simulation outcomes, with 2D and 3D FEL analyses demonstrating the structural conformation of the complexes. Overall, our findings suggest that C13 is a promising hit compound targeting tyrosine-protein kinase (ErbB2), capable of disrupting homodimer formation in HER2-positive breast cancer progression.",

This phase 1 nonrandomized clinical trial of dose escalation enrolled patients with HR+, ERBB2-negative, cN0 invasive breast cancer not requiring chemotherapy from a single academic center between December 2019 and April 2024. Patients were treated with 30, 34, or 38 Gy using MR-guided linear accelerator (MR-LINAC), robotic radiosurgery, or cobalt stereotactic unit. Patients received endocrine therapy and delayed surgery (\u226412 months). The MTD was evaluated using dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as grade 3 or higher toxic effects within 90 days. Additionally, pCR, near pCR (npCR), the association of dose escalation with time to surgery, local control, surgical morbidity, and cosmesis were evaluated. A total of 44 patients (median [range] age, 64.5 [44.0-77.0] years) were treated, with 14 (31.8%) receiving 30 Gy (median [IQR] follow-up, 52.0 [28.2-54.5] months), 15 (34.1%) receiving 34 Gy (median [IQR] follow-up, 40.0 [36.5-41.0] months), and 15 (31.4%) receiving 38 Gy (median [IQR] follow-up, 20.0 [17.0-22.0] months). MTD was not reached. pCR rates were 35.7% (5 patients), 46.7% (7 patients), and 66.7% (10 patients), while pCR with npCR rates were 64.3% (9 patients), 93.3% (14 patients), and 93.3% (14 patients), respectively. Local control was 100%, and surgical morbidity was 2.2% (1 of 44 patients).

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) is clinically beneficial in HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. However, therapeutic resistance emerges over time in most patients, with poorly defined resistance mechanisms. Through a molecular characterization of paired patient specimens before and after T-DXd treatment, we found that 49% cases had major decreases in HER2 expression at progression, and among them, 52% exhibited complete HER2 loss. Using isogenic model systems, we demonstrated that decreases in HER2 expression corresponded to reductions in T-DXd internalization and major increases in drug IC50 value for tumor growth inhibition. We further identified and validated ERBB2 mutations in the trastuzumab binding interface (V597M and P593R) that promoted T-DXd resistance. As a strategy to overcome impaired T-DXd binding and internalization, we tested low-dose combinations of T-DXd with TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and found that these could more uniformly deliver DXd payloads and thereby overcome resistance mediated by HER2 loss. The mechanisms underlying clinical T-DXd resistance have not been established. We now report on two mechanisms of resistance that converge on loss of target binding and propose combinations of distinct ADCs with shared payloads as a strategy to overcome resistance by enhancing intratumor delivery.

To compare the incidence of cardiotoxic effects of ADCs vs standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens for ERBB2-positive locally advanced or metastatic BC. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched in December 2024 for studies published between 2000 and 2024. The included studies were (1) phase 3 clinical trials that investigated locally advanced or metastatic ERBB2-positive BC; (2) clearly defined left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease or heart failure definitions; (3) clearly defined LVEF monitoring frequency by echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan; (4) included studies consisted solely of either trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab deruxtecan, or one of the first-line to fourth-line chemotherapy regimens for unresectable stage IV ERBB2-positive breast cancer per the 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines; and (5) clearly defined cardiovascular eligibility criteria. Data from eligible studies were extracted by 3 reviewers. A random-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed. The primary outcome was cardiotoxic effects, which were defined as the incidence of LVEF decrease. The pooled analysis was performed using logit-transformed proportions with the inverse variance method and a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model for between-study variance, with Wilson score 95% CIs. In this meta-analysis of 9538 patients, a pooled analysis demonstrated a 0.94% (95% CI, 0.56%-1.57%) incidence of LVEF decrease with trastuzumab emtansine, a 4.20% (95% CI, 2.91%-6.01%) incidence with trastuzumab deruxtecan, a 4.85% (95% CI, 3.73%-6.28%) incidence with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, and a 5.52% (95% CI, 3.41%-8.83%) incidence with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus chemotherapy.

This meta-analysis found that trastuzumab emtansine was associated with the lowest incidence of LVEF decrease, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus chemotherapy had similar incidences. More research is needed into the cardiotoxic effects of these therapies.",

    "title": "Risk Factors for Disease Recurrence in Patients with HER2+ Early Breast Cancer and Implications for Therapy: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a02 (HER2) overexpression or amplification of the human ERBB2 oncogene occurs in approximately one-fifth of breast cancers and, of these, two-thirds are hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR+). The introduction of HER2-targeted therapies in recent years has significantly improved survival outcomes in patients with this tumor subtype. However, disease recurrence risk is 10-30% at 5\u00a0years with a different pattern between patients with HER2+/HR+ and HER2+/HR-negative (HR-) early breast cancer, with HR+\u2009patients having a lower risk than those with HR-\u2009disease in the first 5\u00a0years, but a slightly higher risk at 5-10\u00a0years post-surgery. This highlights a crucial need to explore the underlying mechanisms for these differences to address specific treatment needs and to optimize systemic adjuvant treatment outcomes. Therefore, this narrative review provides an overview of published data regarding the recognized factors and ongoing challenges associated with the risk of relapse in women with HER2+ early breast cancer and proposes potential adjuvant treatment strategies to minimize risk of recurrence in high-risk patients.",

The primary objective of this study was to assess the concordance between STRAT4 mRNA measurements of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, and MKi67 obtained from diagnostic core biopsies of the ABCSG Trial 34 with central reference laboratory immunohistochemistry (IHC) (and in-situ hybridization for HER2 IHC 2+ samples). For each marker, overall percent agreement (concordance), positive percent agreement (sensitivity), and negative percent agreement (specificity) between STRAT4 and IHC were determined. The secondary objective was to evaluate the concordance of STRAT 4 and IHC in post-treatment surgical samples and the association of both assays with residual cancer burden (RCB), time to distant recurrence (DR), and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression and Cox regression models were used. A total of 354 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic core biopsies were examined, representing 88.5\u00a0% of the available samples. Concordance between STRAT 4 and IHC was 93.7\u00a0% for ER, 80.5\u00a0% for PR, and 94.1\u00a0% for Ki67. All three biomarkers tested by either STRAT4 or central IHC showed similar correlation to RCB, time to DR, and OS. In diagnostic core biopsies, there was a good agreement between STRAT4 mRNA measurements and centrally assessed IHC measurements of ER, and moderate agreement for PR and Ki67.",

    "title": "Combining Mendelian randomization and network toxicology to decipher the causal role and molecular mechanisms of environmental pollutants in breast cancer: A focus on Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate.",
    "abstract": "Methylparaben (MEP), a ubiquitous preservative, is an endocrine disruptor with established estrogenic activity. However, its potential non-estrogenic mechanisms and causal role in breast cancer (BC) remain inadequately explored. We employed an integrative multi-omics approach. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted using genetic instruments for urinary MEP sulfate (n\u202f=\u202f8285) and BC risk data from the FinnGen consortium (n\u202f=\u202f182,927). To hypothesize underlying molecular mechanisms, we integrated network toxicology with transcriptomic profiling (TCGA), single-cell/spatial RNA-sequencing, and molecular docking. Shared genes were identified via Venn analysis, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, hub gene identification, and functional enrichment analysis. MR analysis provided evidence consistent with a causal relationship, suggesting that genetically predicted MEP levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (IVW OR = 1.08, 95\u202f% CI: 1.009-1.160, P\u202f=\u202f0.027). Network toxicology identified 22 overlapping hub genes connecting MEP targets to BC pathogenesis. Enrichment analyses implicated key oncogenic pathways, including PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling, as well as metabolic reprogramming. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics localized predominant expression of hub genes like MYC and ERBB2 within malignant epithelial cells. Molecular docking further suggested plausible, high-affinity binding (binding energy < 0\u202fkcal/mol) of MEP to core targets such as EGFR and JUN. This study provides genetic evidence supporting a potential causal role of MEP in breast cancer. We propose a novel, estrogen receptor-independent mechanistic hypothesis wherein MEP may promote tumorigenesis by dysregulating growth factor signaling, activating key transcription factors, and inducing metabolic reprogramming. These findings highlight the need for a re-evaluation of MEP's public health impact and offer a framework for future experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "We performed multiomic factor analysis of biomarkers potentially associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) after a chemotherapy-free combination of immunotherapy and dual ERBB2 (HER2) blockade. Forty-eight patients with HER2 2+ (ISH+) or 3+ early breast cancer, stage I to III, and HER2-enriched subtype received pembrolizumab, trastuzumab biosimilar, and pertuzumab. The primary outcome was pCR (ypT0/is ypN0). Multiomic factors representing combined markers from pooling different translational research marker data were identified based on the eigenvalue >1 criteria. Additionally, logistic regressions with elastic net regularization were performed using all single markers, multiomic factors, and clinical characteristics to evaluate their association with pCR. The multiomic factor involving genes related to immune response and tumorigenesis, multiplexed IHC markers related to immune response and HER2 in the stroma, and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with pCR. pCR rates were 66.7% and 28.6% in the high (>median) and low (\u2264median) factor score groups, respectively (unadjusted OR, 5.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-18.56; nominal P = 0.016). In the analysis using standardized values for all individual markers from gene expression analysis, multiplexed IHC analysis in the stroma, and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, markers with the greatest impact on pCR were the genes FNBP1, CD36, MYCN, and SIX1 (OR between 1.43 and 1.62), and progesterone receptor status (OR, 0.65), which surpassed grade (OR, 1.22) and nodal status (OR, 0.90). Our multiomic analysis uncovered mechanisms of tumor response to immunotherapy combined with dual HER2 blockade. These results could inform the design of larger trials investigating chemotherapy-free regimens in selected patients with HER2+ early breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Taxanes are drugs commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. Despite their proven therapeutic efficacy, they can induce severe toxicities, which can be investigated by pharmacogenomics. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate 26 molecular biomarkers in 17 pharmacogenes (CYP2C8, ABCB1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP19A1, CYP3A5, ERCC1, ERBB2, VEGFA, ERCC2, MDM2, MTHFR, RAD51, SOD2, TP53, TANC1 and XRCC1), in women with Breast Cancer undergoing Taxane treatment in the Brazilian Amazon region. This study was carried out with 279 women diagnosed with BC, undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy treatment based on Taxanes (Docetaxel and Paclitaxel), in Brazilian Amazon region. 26 pharmacogenetic markers located in 17 genes involved in the metabolic pathway of Taxanes and related toxicities were selected. Single nucleotide variants were genotyped by allelic discrimination using TaqMan OpenArray Genotyping technology. The study population showed significant associations of Taxane toxicities with ten variants of nine genes: CYP1A1, CYP19A1, CYP3A5, ERCC1, VEGFA, ERCC2, MTHFR, TANC1 and XRCC1. Notably, variants in TANC1 and XRCC1, previously associated with radiotoxicity, were also implicated in Taxane-induced toxicities. The study demonstrated that novel biomarkers may be important for investigating Taxane-induced toxicities in breast cancer. These findings represent a unique contribution to the field, potentially enabling more precise chemotherapy selection, particularly for populations such as Amazonian women.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, driving the need for novel therapeutic agents. Here, we report an integrated in silico-in vitro screening pipeline to identify natural products with anticancer activity against key breast cancer targets. A library of 187,119 commercially available natural compounds from the ZINC database was subjected to molecular docking against five proteins implicated in breast tumorigenesis: mutant PIK3CA-E545K, overexpressed ESR1, mutant ERBB4-Y1242C, overexpressed EGFR, and overexpressed ERBB2. The top 15 compounds (C1-C15) were selected based on binding affinity and commercial availability, then evaluated for cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3) and a normal fibroblast line (CCD-1064Sk). Several hits (most notably C3-C7 and C10) demonstrated potent binding (affinities\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-8.6\u00a0kcal/mol) with favorable selectivity indices (SI\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.0). A clear correlation between more negative docking scores and enhanced cytotoxicity supported the predictive value of our virtual screen. Structure-activity relationship analysis highlighted planarity and hydrophobic substituents as key drivers of activity. These findings validate our hybrid approach and identify promising natural-product leads for further preclinical evaluation in breast cancer models.",

    "abstract": "Male breast cancer (MBC) is very rare, and previous reports of brain metastases (BM) from MBC are limited. To date, the genetic characteristics of MBC with BM have not been explored. In addition, there is only a single case report documenting the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for MBC BM. The aim of this study was to summarize genetic alterations associated with BM in patients with MBC and evaluate the safety and efficacy of SRS in this population. Four male patients with a total of 20 MBC BMs treated with SRS were retrospectively reviewed. We defined treatment response as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and local progression (LP), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative incidence rate of LP. The median overall survival was 16.3 months (95% confidence interval: 1.4-31.3 months). The mean age at treatment was 59 years (IQR: 56-60.5 years). Three patients had estrogen receptor-positive lesions, whereas one patient had triple-negative disease. Three patients had notable pathogenic alterations (including in <i>AURKA, BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2, CCND1, CHEK2, ERBB2, FLT3, RAF1,</i> and <i>SPINK1</i>). The median lesion size was 5.7 mm (IQR: 3.9-8.6 mm). The median delivered dose was 23 Gy (IQR: 22-24 Gy). Follow-up imaging at 3 months showed a reduction in median lesion size (3.3 mm). The percentage of lesions which were classified as complete response:partial response:stable disease:LP was 0%:45%:55%:0%, respectively. Cumulative 6-month and 12-month local control rates were 100% and 100%, respectively. Only one lesion demonstrated LP at the last follow-up (15 months). This is the first report of genetic profiling of MBC with BM and excellent SRS outcomes. The receptor status and genetic alterations across our patients with MBC BM suggest heterogeneity in disease. Larger studies are needed to further explore MBC BM characteristics and treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle entry and the irreversible transition from the G1 to S phase are crucial for mammalian cell proliferation. Among the ErbB family, the ErbB2/HER2 receptor is a key driver of cancer growth. However, the quantitative mechanisms underlying the ErbB2-mediated G1/S transition remain unclarified. Here, we performed an extensive time-course analysis of high and low ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells to describe the regulatory mechanisms of the ErbB2-mediated G1/S transition. Live-cell imaging using cell cycle reporters revealed that the G1/S transition occurs 20 h after ErbB2 activation, driven primarily by the cyclin D1/CDK4-RB axis. Hsp90 is regulated by CDK4 activity and controls the stability of ErbB2 protein in a time-dependent manner. CDK4 inhibitor treatment arrested the cell cycle in most cells; a subpopulation showed a 25-h delay in G1/S entry associated with enhanced c-Myc activation. In high ErbB2-expressing cells, CDK4 inhibition led to c-Myc overactivation, a rapid decrease in cyclin D1 expression, and cell cycle arrest. Overall, we demonstrate how ErbB2 receptor levels modulate the roles of cyclin D1 and c-Myc in the G1/S transition and suggest that variations in ErbB2 levels within breast cancer tissues confer heterogeneous sensitivity to CDK4 inhibitors, potentially complicating treatment.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<i>HER2</i>) gene are well-recognized oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The first anti-HER2 inhibitor, trastuzumab-deruxtecan, was approved for previously treated advanced NSCLC with <i>HER2</i> mutations, which accounts for 2-4% of NSCLC. The first anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab, was approved for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in 1998, and a combination therapy comprising trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel demonstrated efficacy in the first-line setting. Some EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been evaluated as pan-HER TKIs but have shown limited benefits in <i>HER2</i>-altered NSCLC. However, HER2-specific TKIs, such as zongertinib and BAY2927088, have demonstrated encouraging results. Zongertinib was the first HER2-specific TKI to be approved by the FDA in 2025 for previously treated <i>ERBB2</i>-mutated advanced NSCLC. In this narrative review, we have summarized the latest research on the biology of HER2 signaling, HER2 alterations, HER2-targeting therapies, and challenges of treating HER2-overexpressing or -mutated NSCLC. Despite different targets of <i>HER2</i> mutations in NSCLC and HER2 amplification/overexpression in breast cancer, the development of HER2-targeting agents has been more advanced in breast cancer than in NSCLC. Therefore, pivotal clinical studies in breast cancer may help in identifying more effective therapies for NSCLC.",
