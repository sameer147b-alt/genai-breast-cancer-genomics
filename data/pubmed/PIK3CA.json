    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer, potentially offering a more comprehensive representation of tumor genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we assessed the prognostic and monitoring values of ctDNA at multiple clinical time points during diagnosis and therapy. A total of 119 patients with breast cancer underwent ctDNA analysis using next-generation sequencing, targeting 47 breast cancer-related genes at three predefined time points (baseline, post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy [post-NAC], and follow-up). Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed based on ctDNA status. ctDNA was detected in 50.9% of patients at baseline, 25.0% post-NAC, and 58.3% during follow-up. ctDNA positivity was associated with worse DFS at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 7.54, 95% CI: 1.71-33.17, P\u2009=\u20090.008), post-NAC (HR 3.54, 95% CI: 1.24-10.12, P\u2009=\u20090.018), and follow-up (HR 7.68, 95% CI: 0.98-59.97, P\u2009=\u20090.052). TP53 mutations were the most frequently observed, present in 37.5%, 14.8%, and 20.4% of patients at baseline, post-NAC, and follow-up, respectively. PIK3CA mutations were the second most common, detected in 11.6%, 4.5%, and 5.8% of patients, respectively. ctDNA positivity for these mutations consistently showed elevated HRs for disease progression across clinical time points (HR range, 2.73-20.49). ctDNA non-clearance was associated with the highest risk of disease progression (HR 81.09, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and remained the strongest independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 52.07, P\u2009<\u20090.001). ctDNA analysis provides significant clinical utility for prognostic stratification and disease monitoring in breast cancer management.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer, characterized by poor prognosis and limited treatment options. With the advancements in precision oncology, liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising, non-invasive tool for diagnosing TNBC, predicting prognosis, and monitoring treatment response. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other biomarkers, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), exosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs, offer valuable insights into tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and therapeutic efficacy. Recent research has indicated that the presence of ctDNA following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with reduced progression-free survival. Additionally, mutations in key genes such as <i>TP53</i> and <i>PIK3CA/AKT</i>, along with microRNA alterations (e.g., miR17, miR19a, miR105), have been identified as potential indicators of treatment response and resistance. Furthermore, the study of CTCs enables real-time tumor dissemination profiling, which may enhance prognostic accuracy. Despite these promising developments, significant challenges persist in the standardization and clinical implementation of liquid biopsy techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current and future applications of liquid biopsy in TNBC management, highlighting its potential to improve early disease detection, optimize therapeutic strategies, and refine patient classification. Integrating liquid biopsy into routine clinical practice could lead to better treatment outcomes and more personalized approaches to TNBC care.",

    "abstract": "The prognostic value of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase p110\u03b1, a key catalytic subunit in the PI3K/AKT pathway, in breast cancer remains controversial. This study evaluated its prognostic significance in stage I-III invasive breast cancer. p110\u03b1 protein expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 161 patient tissue samples. Its association with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. p110\u03b1 positivity was detected in 59.0% of specimens and showed significant correlation with histological grade (<i>p</i> = 0.034). Survival analysis revealed that p110\u03b1 positivity was associated with worse OS (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.008) and RFS (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.018). In multivariate analysis, p110\u03b1 expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis for both OS (HR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.25-4.78) and RFS (HR = 2.12, 95%CI: 1.14-3.94). This association with poor prognosis was particularly pronounced in stage I-II, hormone receptor (HR)-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative subgroups. Supporting evidence from the PROGgeneV2 database showed that high <i>PIK3CA</i> mRNA levels predicted inferior survival in external cohorts. p110\u03b1 protein expression is an independent biomarker for adverse outcomes in stage I-III invasive breast cancer. Its assessment could improve prognostic evaluation and guide personalized therapy.",

Characterized by well-circumscribed lesions lacking peripheral and central myoepithelial cells, EPC is associated with favorable prognosis due to its indolent behavior and high hormone receptor positivity. However, its potential association with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma necessitates thorough diagnostic evaluation. This study presents two cases of EPC-one in a 57-year-old and the other in a 39-year-old female-each with focal DCIS and strong estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. Both patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and were managed with hormone therapy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the EPC diagnosis, and molecular insights revealed common mutations, particularly in the PIK3CA gene. This report underscores the importance of integrating clinical, histological, and molecular findings to guide diagnosis and management of EPC, which, despite its low invasive potential, shares genetic features with invasive ductal carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "This phase 3b study prospectively evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of baseline and dynamic circulating tumor (ctDNA) in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) treated with first-lineribociclib/letrozole. A total of 287 patients were enrolled, with ctDNA analyzed at baseline (n=263), day 15 of cycle 1 (C1D15; n=238), C2D1 (n=241), and at first imaging (n=206). The primary objective was to identify ctDNA alterations, characterize their evolution across treatment time points, and assess their association with progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 23.4 months (95% CI: 20.8-non estimable [NE]). At baseline, the most frequently altered genes were PIK3CA (22.1%) and TP53 (15.5%). Alterations in TP53, MYC, and HER- and CDK4/6- pathway genes were linked to early progression. Absence of a detectable mutation at baseline (n=150, 57.0%) was associated with better prognosis (HR=0.41). Among patients with a detectable mutation at baseline (n=104), early clearance (mutation undetectability) was observed in 47.1% at C1D15 and 52.4% at C2D1, and associated with improved PFS (C1D15, HR=0.51; C2D1, HR=0.44). In patients without a detectable mutation at baseline, 22.7% (n=34) developed new mutations at C1D15, C2D1, or first imaging. Patients without new mutations had a lower risk of progression (HR=0.45). Pretreatment and early dynamics of ctDNA represent promising prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with ribociclib/letrozole. Early ctDNA dynamic appeared a promising surrogate biomarker for treatment. Further studies are warranted to validate their clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health burden, with a rising incidence and mortality rate, particularly among younger women. Despite substantial therapeutic progress, effective molecular targets for treatment remain limited. This study investigated the oncogenic function of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and assessed the anti-cancer potential of formononetin using integrated bioinformatics and computational analyses. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles were assessed using SwissADME, pkCSM, and Protox-II. Potential drug and disease targets were retrieved from SwissTarget, TargetNet, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases, identifying 45 overlapping targets. Protein-protein interaction mapping via STRING and topological analysis in Cytoscape highlighted TERT, PIK3CA, ESR1, and KIT as key nodes. Molecular docking revealed high binding affinities of formononetin toward TERT (-\u20098.15\u00a0kcal/mol) and PIK3CA (-\u20098.01\u00a0kcal/mol). Gene expression profiling using GEPIA2 confirmed significant over expression of TERT and PIK3CA in breast carcinoma tissues. Pathway enrichment analysis, conducted through ShinyGO, in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, elucidated the electronic and interaction dynamics underlying ligand-target stability. Collectively, these findings suggest that formononetin may be a promising lead compound for targeting TERT-driven breast cancer, warranting further in vivo and clinical validation to establish its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Camizestrant, the next-generation oral selective estrogen receptor degrader and complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, has previously demonstrated superiority over fulvestrant in patients with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Capivasertib is a selective AKT inhibitor recommended with fulvestrant for patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Here, we report data from Parts I and J of SERENA-1 (NCT03616587), evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy for the combination of camizestrant and capivasertib. SERENA-1 is a phase I, open-label, multi-part trial of camizestrant alone and in combination with other anticancer agents in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. In parts I and J, participants received oral camizestrant 75 mg (once daily) in combination with oral capivasertib 400 mg (4 days on, 3 days off). Participants (n = 29) had a median of two previous lines of therapy in the advanced setting; 55.2% had received fulvestrant and 89.7% had received a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor. Camizestrant in combination with capivasertib had a well-tolerated safety profile, with diarrhea (75.9%) and nausea (44.8%) being the most common adverse events.

However, its cost-effectiveness in China remains unclear. A partitioned survival model with three health states-progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death-was developed to evaluate inavolisib plus palbociclib-fulvestrant versus palbociclib-fulvestrant alone from the Chinese healthcare perspective. Survival data were derived from the phase III INAVO120 trial, while costs and utility values were obtained from local sources and literature. The model estimated total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) and scenario analyses were conducted to assess model robustness and the impact of drug price and time horizon variations. Inavolisib combination therapy increased total costs ($194306.06 vs. $55938.19) and QALYs (2.999 vs. 1.744), resulting in an ICER of $110260.53/QALY, exceeding the Chinese willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $40271.00/QALY. ICER was most sensitive to PFS utility and drug cost. Scenario analyses indicated that inavolisib would become cost-effective if its price decreased by approximately 88.53%. While inavolisib plus palbociclib-fulvestrant significantly prolongs PFS and OS in PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC, it is not cost-effective at current prices in China. Strategic price adjustments or reimbursement negotiations are essential to improve economic feasibility and inform clinical and policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is known to be a disease of altered cellular signaling; however, the relationship between mutation-specific changes to signal transduction and the phenotypic consequences produced remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate two common breast cancer driver mutations, the <i>PIK3CA</i><sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> mutation and the <i>ErbB2</i> amplification, both of which activate the PI3K-Akt pathway but paradoxically drive distinct cellular outcomes. Indeed, in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells, PI3K<sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> expression induced features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while ErbB2<sup><i>amp</i></sup> cells exhibited a hyperproliferative phenotype. Characterization of PI3K axis signaling revealed that ErbB2<sup><i>amp</i></sup> cells display prolonged, stimulus-dependent PI3K activation, whereas PI3K<sup><i>H1047R</i></sup> cells show constitutive, ligand-independent signaling. To test whether these distinct dynamics contribute to the phenotypic responses, we employed an iLID-based optogenetic system that enables precise, tunable control of endogenous PI3K activity. Using this tool to mimic the mutation-specific dynamics in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, we found that PI3K signaling patterns alone were sufficient to reproduce key features of the <i>PIK3CA H1047R</i>-associated EMT phenotype but not the <i>ErbB2</i>-associated proliferative phenotype. These findings suggest that the temporal encoding of pathway activity, not merely its magnitude, can drive some phenotypic changes in oncogenic progression, explain how distinct mutations within a common signaling pathway can produce divergent cellular phenotypes, and provide a workflow for interrogating the functional consequences of changes in signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer (BC) is an emerging subtype with specific clinicopathological features and therapeutic strategies. However, limited studies are available on the molecular characteristics and prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study was conducted using the clinicopathological and genomic data of 1006 TNBCs, which were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University (SRRSH) cohorts. The clinicopathological features, survival outcomes, molecular characteristics, and immune profiles of TNBCs based on HER2 status were evaluated. Patients were stratified into HER2-low (N = 676) and HER2-zero (N = 330) groups according to their HER2 status. We found HER2-low TNBCs had a lower histological grade and Ki67 index compared to the HER2-zero subgroup in the SRRSH cohort. However, no significant association has been found between the HER2 status and the disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), or overall survival (OS) in TNBCs. Genomic mutation analysis showed that the HER2-low TNBCs exhibited higher mutated frequencies of PIK3CA, MUC17, and PTEN, while FAT3, RYR2, and CSMD3 were more frequently mutated in the HER2-zero subgroup. Furthermore, the combined mutation of PIK3CA and MUC17, which had a higher frequency in the HER2-low subgroup, was associated with poorer survival in TNBCs. Immune profile analysis revealed a higher percentage of plasma cells in patients with low HER2 expression. Taken together, our study reflected the impact of the HER2 status on the clinicopathological and molecular features of TNBCs, which might offer additional introspection and improvement for translational studies and therapeutic decisions for TNBCs.",

This study aimed to investigate clinicopathologic and somatic alterations in breast tumors stratified by HER2 status. Ninety breast cancer patients were stratified by HER2 expression (1+, 2+, 3+) using immunohistochemistry and confirmed by FISH. For each patient, paired diagnostic biopsies and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) residual tumors were analyzed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 34 paired samples, and shortlisted variants were validated by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) in 90 cases. Among the 90 paired samples, 40 were HER2-high, and 50 were HER2-low/TNBC. HER2-high tumors presented with a larger mean size (3.34\u00a0cm vs. 2.29\u00a0cm) but lower lymph-node metastasis (40% vs. 60%) compared to HER2-low/TNBC. NGS identified frequent mutations in PIK3CA (24%), TP53 (32%), and ERBB2 (9%). PIK3CA variants His1047Arg and Glu542Lys exhibited significantly higher variant allele frequencies in post-NACT tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.05). HER2-high tumors demonstrated a greater prevalence of ERBB2 mutations (13.5%), whereas in HER2-low patients, such mutations appeared only after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).

HER2-high and HER2-low/TNBC breast cancers demonstrate distinct clinicopathologic and molecular profiles. Therapy-associated enrichment of PIK3CA mutations and their association with aggressive behavior underscore their prognostic and therapeutic significance in HER2-positive disease.

Furthermore, the compound 2j upregulated the expression of genes like Bax, BRCA1, Caspase-3, CDKN1A, Mcl-1, and PIK3CA, potentially influencing apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT pathway. The compound 2j significantly inhibited the MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation by downregulation of EGFR, p-EGFR, and p-AKT protein expression levels. Molecular docking studies revealed that compound 2j had a strong binding affinity and interacted closely with key catalytic residues of EGFR, outperforming erlotinib, a known EGFR inhibitor, suggesting its potential as an anti-breast cancer drug candidate.",

While gene mutation profiling provides valuable insights into recurrent mutations and genomic heterogeneity, the comparative mutational characteristics distinguishing TNBC from non-TNBC tumors have not been comprehensively investigated. This study aims to elucidate these differences through a systematic comparative analysis. We retrieved clinical data and somatic mutation profiles of 704 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on hormone receptor expression status, the breast cancer samples were stratified into TNBC cohort (n\u2009=\u2009109) and non-TNBC cohort (n\u2009=\u2009595). Comprehensive genomic analysis was performed to compare differences in mutational profiles between the two cohorts, including differential frequencies of recurrent mutations, interaction patterns of co-occurring and mutually exclusive mutations, driver genes, decomposition of mutational signatures using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database, and pathway enrichment of significantly altered genes. Compared to the non-TNBC cohort, the TNBC patients had a younger age at onset. Significant differences were observed in the mutation rate of TP53 (81% vs. 27%, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-\u200916</sup>), PIK3CA (11% vs. 38%, p\u2009=\u20095.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-\u20099</sup>) and GATA3 (1% vs. 16%, p\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-\u20096</sup>) between TNBC and non-TNBC cohorts. TNBC also exhibited a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) than non-TNBC (1.2 vs. 0.6 mutations/Mb). Genes in TNBC predominantly exhibited a co-mutation pattern, whereas non-TNBC showed either co-occurring or mutually exclusive mutational relationships. TTN and PIK3CA were identified as key driver genes in TNBC, while non-TNBC exhibited greater diversity in driver alterations, including MAP3K1 and KMT2C. Mutational signature analysis revealed that Single-Base Substitution2 (SBS2) and SBS6 were common to both cohorts, while SBS3 and SBS26 were predominantly enriched in TNBC, and SBS10b was more frequent in non-TNBC. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most affected oncogenic pathways in TNBC were TP53, TGF-Beta, RTK-RAS, and Hippo pathways, whereas non-TNBC involved TP53, TGF-Beta, NRF2, PI3K, and RTK-RAS pathways. Our study delineates the distinct genomic mutational landscapes between TNBC and non-TNBC cohorts, and reveals somatic interactions, driver genes, mutational signatures and pathway enrichment. These findings highlight the distinct molecular features of TNBC, which may contribute to its aggressive clinical behavior.",

    "abstract": "Precision oncology requires robust methods for simultaneous mutation detection and variant allele frequency (VAF) quantification to guide therapeutic decisions. Current technologies face limitations in sensitivity, cost, and workflow complexity, particularly for assessing tumor heterogeneity. The development of dual-mode temperature-switchable TSCP probes addresses these challenges through an innovative competitive hybridization approach. The TSCP platform demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting PIK3CA mutations while precisely quantifying VAF values. By combining temperature-programmed specificity with hybridization chain reaction amplification, the system achieves high sensitivity across a broad dynamic range. Validation studies confirm reliable mutation detection and accurate VAF measurement in both cell line models and clinical samples, outperforming conventional methods in reproducibility and accuracy. The enzyme-free, isothermal workflow operates without specialized instrumentation, offering a practical solution for clinical implementation. This technology represents a significant advancement in molecular diagnostics by integrating mutation detection and clonality assessment in a single assay. Its cost-effective design and modular architecture make it adaptable for various oncogenic mutations, providing clinicians with a powerful tool for therapy selection and tumor heterogeneity monitoring. The platform's capabilities in detecting low-frequency variants suggest promising applications in minimal residual disease monitoring and liquid biopsy analysis, potentially transforming precision oncology practice. Future development will focus on enhancing multiplexing capacity and microfluidic integration to further expand its clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer in young adults (YA) aged 20-40 years has distinct clinical and biological traits compared with older patients. This study evaluated the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancers (MBC) among YA. Patients with MBC enrolled in the STING molecular profile platform (NCT04932525) between 2021 and May 2023 were included. Clinical and genomic features were analyzed by age (\u226440 vs\u00a0>\u00a040 years). Tumor profiling used the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay (324 genes) at baseline or later in the disease course. Variant frequencies were compared across age groups. Of 432 eligible patients, 68 (16\u00a0%) were YA. Among 37\u00a0YA with hormone receptor positive (HR+) BC, frequent alterations included TP53 (39\u00a0%), ESR1 (27\u00a0%), PIK3CA (25\u00a0%), FGFR3 (18\u00a0%), FGFR4 (18\u00a0%), FGFR19 (18\u00a0%), CCND1 (18\u00a0%). Compared with older patients, YA with HR\u00a0+\u00a0tumors had fewer RB1 (7\u00a0% vs 8\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and PIK3CA (25\u00a0% vs 31\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) alterations. Among 28\u00a0YA with triple negative BC, the most common alterations were TP53 (100\u00a0%), PTEN (26\u00a0%), BRCA1 (22\u00a0%), RB1 (17\u00a0%). PTEN mutations were more frequent among YA with TNBC than older patients (26\u00a0% vs 8\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Tiers I-III genomic alterations according to the ESMO scale of clinical actionability (ESCAT) were identified in 54\u00a0YA (79\u00a0%), including 48 tiers I-II alterations comprising ESR1 (n\u00a0=\u00a012), gBRCA1/2 (n\u00a0=\u00a011), PIK3CA (n\u00a0=\u00a013). ESCAT tiers I-III alterations were reported in 79\u00a0% YA with MBC which supports the role of molecular profiling in YA. The differences detected in the genomic profiles of YA with BC and older patients may allude to potential different underlying disease biology.",

    "abstract": "Compared with female breast cancer (FBC), male breast cancer (MBC) is often detected at the advanced stage and has a poorer prognosis. Due to the limited research data on MBC, its clinical diagnosis and treatment regimens are mainly based on FBC, although these regimens may not be appropriate for MBC patients. This study aimed to investigate the similarities and differences between MBC and FBC at the genetic level, in order to provide ideas and basis for the diagnosis and treatment of MBC. In this cross-sectional study, we conducted high-throughput sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples obtained from a cohort of 12 MBC and 14 FBC patients. Utilizing bioinformatics tools, we meticulously analyzed and compared the genomic profiles to elucidate the underlying genetic distinctions between MBC and FBC. In our study, <i>MLL3</i> and <i>GATA3</i> mutations were most prevalent in MBC while <i>TP53</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>MLL3</i> mutations dominated in FBC. Notably, certain genes exhibited shared point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across genders. The mutation prevalence of <i>PIK3CA</i> was significantly different between MBC and FBC. <i>CDK12</i> and <i>ERBB2</i> had the highest prevalence of CNV in FBC, contrasting with their absence in MBC. Both in MBC and FBC, <i>MYC</i> had the highest prevalence in CNV. Furthermore, FBC demonstrated a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) than MBC. MBC private genes were involved in a variety of disease-related signaling pathways, with the ErbB and PI3K-Akt pathways being significantly enriched. We concluded that MBC and FBC exhibit both genomic similarities and distinctions in our study. In the context of precision medicine, this study may provide new ideas and a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of MBC.",

    "abstract": "Background Breast carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality in women\u00a0worldwide. Although several advances have been made in molecularly classifying breast cancers, treatment resistance continues to limit the overall survival. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has unraveled diverse genomic alterations in breast carcinoma. However, some potential biomarkers still remain unexplored, like SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase involved in epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. ARMCX5 and SLCO6A1 are also some of the unexplored genes that could have a potential role in drug resistance. Materials and methods The Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) data set from the Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) cohort was analyzed using the Maftools, Survival, Mclust, and Survminer R packages.\u00a0Oncodrive driver analysis and protein family (PFAM) domain mapping were performed.\u00a0A total of 845 cases of breast carcinoma with complete survival data were retrieved, of which mutation data for 800 cases were available. Comprehensive mutation analysis was also done to unveil unexplored genes. Survival data of 845 cases were integrated for Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis to ascertain the prognostic significance of an array of genes. Oncogenic signaling pathway mapping was done to determine the clinical enrichment of the genes associated with breast carcinoma. Genes associated with clinical enrichment, clustering of somatic mutations, and prognosis were subjected to further analysis. Results Besides the established molecular drivers like PIK3CA and TP53, we found several novel and understudied genes with potential prognostic and oncogenic significance. SETDB1 (p < 0.0001), USP37 (p < 0.0001), NDUFS1 (p = 0.025), TRPM4 (p < 0.0001), and MYO18A (p < 0.0001) were associated with poor prognosis. ARMCX5 (p < 0.0001)\u00a0and SLCO6A1 (p < 0.0001)\u00a0were enriched in high-grade tumors. Conclusion The TCGA-BRCA cohort analysis emphasizes a potential interplay of metabolic genes like NDUFS1, TRPM4, ARMCX5, SLCO6A1, and epigenetic axis genes like SETDB1 and USP37 in the oncogenesis and prognosis of breast carcinomas. These observations could open potential avenues for exploring novel therapeutics in aggressive breast carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "The absence of accurate, rapid, fully automated, and cost-effective detection methods has hindered the clinical translation of tumor-derived DNA mutations as cancer biomarkers. Here, we develop a sample-to-answer platform, termed multiplexed droplet digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based lab-on-a-disc (mddLAMP-LoD), for rapid and allele-specific detection of cancer-associated mutations. The system seamlessly combines automated microfluidics, an improved allele-specific LAMP assay with mismatch-engineered primer design for single-nucleotide discrimination, and artificial intelligence-assisted droplet imaging to enable precise mutation quantification. Full automation is realized through a combination of microfluidic passive valves, a gelatin-based thermosensitive active valve, a static magnetic field-driven on-chip nucleic acid extraction module, and polysaccharide additives that preserve water-in-oil droplet stability for over 1.5\u00a0h under thermal amplification. The mddLAMP-LoD platform demonstrates superior performance in detecting multiplex PIK3CA point mutations, achieving detection limits at the attomolar level or as low as100\u00a0cells, with a linear range of 0-6362 copies/\u03bcL. When coupled with deep learning, it exhibits high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, showing strong concordance with commercial kits in the analyses of breast cancer tissue and plasma samples. Using a 0.1\u00a0% mutation threshold, PIK3CA mutation frequency in adjacent tissue effectively predicts breast cancer prognosis, while serum PIK3CA profiles correlate with cancer staging and track disease progression. We validated that the mddLAMP-LoD system provides rapid, ultrasensitive mutation profiling suited for intraoperative molecular diagnosis and point-of-care liquid biopsy, representing a significant advance toward accessible precision oncology.",

    "title": "Predictive Value of PIK3CA Mutations for Response to CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Currently, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors combined with hormone therapy are the standard treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. It remains unclear which patients benefit most from CDK4/6 inhibitors and whether predictive biomarkers exist to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, we evaluate the association between phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation status and treatment response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We extensively searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for articles published until December 2024. The primary outcome of our study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Seven studies-involving 2221 women with HR+/HER2 metastatic breast cancer-were systematically analyzed. The pooled results showed that patients with PIK3CA mutation had significantly poorer PFS than those with PIK3CA wild-type (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22-1.77; P<0.0001). Similarly, PIK3CA mutation was associated with significantly poorer OS than PIK3CA wild-type (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06-1.89; P=0.02). ORR was only reported in one study, with the results showing that the ORR was higher in patients with wild-type PIK3CA than in patients with PIK3CA alteration (53/180 (29%) versus 13/85 (15%). PIK3CA mutation correlates with poor PFS and OS in patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, PIK3CA mutation status should be considered a potential predictive biomarker of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.",

A partitioned survival model was used, with survival data from the INAVO120 clinical trials. Primary outcomes assessed were costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the uncertainty of model inputs. Changes in treatment efficacy were modeled to assess their impact on cost-effectiveness. Subgroup analysis was also conducted to refine the findings. In the base-case analysis, the inavolisib triple regimen showed an ICER of $249,487.22/QALY in the U.S. and $43,812.01/QALY in China, both exceeding their respective willingness-to-pay thresholds. Price simulation indicated that the inavolisib-based combination would be preferred in China if the price were reduced to $133.19/9\u00a0mg, while a price of $421.13/9\u00a0mg would be required to achieve cost-effectiveness in the U.S. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated robust results from the U.S. perspective, while for China, variations in the price of inavolisib and utility of progression-free-survival influenced the conclusions. Subgroup analyses suggested certain patient subgroups could be cost-effective in the Chinese context. Compared with palbociclib-fulvestrant, the inavolisib triple regimen is not cost-effective at its current price. A substantial price reduction or careful selection of the target patient may be required for the regimen to be economically viable.",

Combining pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with mild magnetothermy (MT) and letrozole could improve the efficacy of treatment. The aim was to assess the effect of combined treatment with PLD, MT, and letrozole on the survival of patients with luminal B postmenopausal aBC with mutations in the PIK3CA gene. The aBC postmenopausal patients who progressed on a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) were included in the study. Group 1 included 20 patients, treated with PLD + MT every 28 days (4 courses) and letrozole (daily per os, 4 months). Group 2 included 20 patients, who received the same treatment without letrozole. By PIK3\u0421\u0410 status, each group included 10 patients with a mutant PIK3\u0421\u0410 and 10 patients with a wild-type gene. Application of PLD + MT in combination with letrozole demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to PLD + MT alone. In group 1, the median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI, 7.4-11.9 months) compared to a median PFS of 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.1-9.7 months) in group 2 (p = 0.005). In the sensitivity analyses, PFS of patients with wild-type PIK3CA in the first cohort was 10.1 months (95% CI, 8.7-11.1 months) compared to 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-10.4 months) in groups 1 and 2 respectively (p = 0.004), by 1:1 greedy nearest neighbor matching.

    "abstract": "Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is linked to mutations in the p53 gene and is characterized by autosomal dominant early-onset familial cancer susceptibility. The p53R181C mutation is one of the earliest described mutations associated with early-onset familial hereditary breast cancer. Highly stable mutant p53 protein is often a prerequisite for tumor initiation and progression, but the pathways leading to p53R181C accumulation and carcinogenesis are not understood. Here, we found that p53 R181C mutation decreases the interaction of p53 with the Sirt1 deacetylase, resulting in increased p53 K382 acetylation and inhibition of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Moreover, the R181C mutation leads to \"loss-of-function\" of transcriptional regulating tumor suppressor genes like p21, bax, and PUMA as well as \"gain-of-function\" of transcriptional regulating tumor promoting genes of PIK3CA, SHC1, SRC and PAK4. This dysregulation promotes genomic instability, enabling cancer cells to evade cell cycle control, senescence and apoptosis, thus facilitating tumor development. Our findings unraveled the mechanism by which the p53R181C mutant protein accumulates and facilitates tumor development.",

One-way sensitivity analysis identified the price of inavolisib as the primary driver of the ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 0% probability of inavolisib being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY.

    "abstract": "Tall cell carcinomas with reversed polarity (TCCRPs) are rare, indolent triple negative or oestrogen receptor (ER)-low positive breast cancers classically characterized by solid-papillary and papillary proliferations of eosinophilic columnar cells with reversed nuclear polarity. IDH2 R172 mutations are key oncogenic drivers in the majority of TCCRPs, exemplary of genotype-phenotype correlation among breast tumours. Other extramammary tumour types with IDH2 mutations can alternatively harbour analogous mutually exclusive IDH1 R132 mutations that appear to have similar effects on genome methylation, cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis. A prior report of a single IDH1-mutated TCCRP suggests extension of the IDH1/2 dichotomy to TCCRPs, but such exceedingly rare tumours have not been further characterized. We identified two cases of TCCRP with IDH1 R132C mutation presenting in postmenopausal females and herein detail their clinical, histomorphologic, immunophenotypic and genetic features. The tumours showed disparate histologic features, with one ER-positive case closely mimicking an intraductal papilloma with florid usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) and the other triple negative case demonstrating more classic features of TCCRP. The immunoprofiles in both cases were similar to TCCRP with IDH2 mutation. By targeted next-generation sequencing, both tumours harboured IDH1 R132C and PIK3CA H1047R mutations. Both patients underwent surgical excision without radiation therapy and were without disease at last follow-up. This study expands the genetic and morphologic repertoire of TCCRP with implications and pitfalls for accurate diagnosis.

This study aimed to observe the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in the cohort, with an exploratory analysis of efficacy-related biomarkers in a subset of patients. This was a prospective, observational, non-interventional cohort study. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with TCbHP neoadjuvant therapy were prospectively collected. Exploratory genomic and transcriptomic biomarker analyses were performed in a subset of patients with available baseline tumour specimens retrospectively collected. A total of 252 patients with a median age of 48\u2009years were enrolled. Patients with stage III were 69.4% (175/252), and clinical N3 patients accounted for 24.6% (62/252). Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive were 62.7% (158/252). Total pCR rate was 55.2% (139/252). HR-negative and HR-positive rates were 72.3% (68/94) and 44.9% (71/158), respectively. Among neoadjuvant taxanes, including paclitaxel, docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, the pCR rates were 50.0% (57/114), 50.0% (41/82), and 73.2% (41/56), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that HR negativity, receiving nab-paclitaxel, HER2 3+, and cT1-2 were independent predictive factors of high pCR. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on baseline tumour specimens from 40 patients. Genomic analysis revealed lower pCR rates in patients with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (odds ratio\u2009=\u200913.47, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.025) and <i>SPOP</i> amplification (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.047) than in wild types.

The study population consisted in 95\u202f% women and 5\u202f% men; median age at diagnosis was 50 years (IQR 44-63); 75\u202f% of the women was postmenopausal;86\u202f% of the total population presented with a secondary endocrine-resistance, 64\u202f% had visceral relapse, 74\u202f% had less than 3 metastatic sites, 79\u202f% had received first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor. PIK3CA status was available for 63/74 pts, with a 29\u202f% prevalence of mutation. PIK3CAmut was a negative prognostic factor for OS (median 65 [wt] vs 36 months [mut], log-rank p 0.024 HR 2.61 [95\u202f% CI 1.10-6.22]) and PFS1 (median 22 [wt] vs 10 months [mut], log-rank p 0.012, HR 2.24 [95\u202f% CI 1.18-4.26]). The co-occurrence of endocrine-resistance and PIK3CAmut identifies a population with unfavorable prognosis, reinforcing the rationale of escalated therapies.",

A total of 2851 patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer were identified. The overall incidence of ESR1 mutations was 4.0% (n = 113). The incidence of ESR1 mutations was higher among patients with metastatic/recurrent disease than those with primary tumors (7.6% vs 3.4%, p < .001). Patients with ESR1-activating mutations also harbored mTOR/PIK3CA pathway genomic alterations: PTEN (75%), PIK3CA (56%), PIK3R1 (42%), AKT1 (12%). Further research to elucidate the clinical impact of ESR1 gene mutations in endometrial cancer are needed. Clinical trials evaluating novel hormonal agents in this patient population are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the most prevalent subtype of breast cancer, is characterized by significant genomic heterogeneity. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has emerged as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response, yet its estimation via whole-exome sequencing remains complex and costly. This study aimed to evaluate whether total somatic mutation count can serve as a practical surrogate for TMB and assess its association with progesterone receptor (PR) status in PIK3CA-mutated IDC patients. This retrospective observational study utilized publicly available data from a previously published breast cancer sequencing study. A total of 164 female IDC patients with confirmed PIK3CA mutations and documented PR status were included. Relevant genomic and demographic parameters - TMB, mutation count, and age - were extracted and analyzed. Statistical analyses included correlation, intergroup comparisons by PR status, and binary logistic regression. Predictive performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Patients with PR-negative status exhibited significantly higher TMB and mutation count than PR-positive patients (p-value<0.001 for both). TMB and mutation count were positively correlated (r=0.61, p-value<0.001), indicating overlapping representation of genomic instability. Logistic regression showed that mutation count was a significant predictor of PR status (p-value=0.01). Mutation count demonstrated a slightly superior predictive performance (AUROC=0.738) compared to TMB (AUROC=0.737). Total mutation count shows strong potential as a surrogate biomarker for TMB and a predictive marker for PR status in PIK3CA-mutated IDC, offering a cost-effective genomic tool in personalized breast cancer stratification.",

    "abstract": "Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressed breast cancer (BC) represents the more aggressive subtype of HR\u2009+\u2009BC, typically associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite significant advancements in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC, resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) poses a continued challenge. Imlunestrant is a next-generation, oral, brain-penetrant, pure antagonistic ER degrader designed to deliver continuous ER target inhibition. It has shown favorable clinical benefit, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) when used as monotherapy or with targeted therapy in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced BC (ABC). Here, we present the safety and efficacy of imlunestrant with HER2 targeted therapy in patients with ER+/HER2\u2009+\u2009ABC of the EMBER trial. Patients were randomized to imlunestrant (400\u00a0mg RP2D)\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab (group A) versus imlunestrant\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab\u2009\u00b1\u2009abemaciclib [(150\u00a0mg twice daily) group B] or received maintenance treatment with imlunestrant\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab\u2009+\u2009pertuzumab until progression or discontinuation at standard doses (group C). In the randomized allocation, eligible patients with locally advanced or metastastic disease had received\u2009\u2265\u20092 prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting, and no prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors or fulvestrant. The maintenance cohort (group C) was added later to include patients without disease progression after first-line induction taxane-based chemotherapy (any duration), trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. Endpoints included safety, PK, antitumor activity, and tumor biomarker assessments. In total, 45 patients with ER+/HER2\u2009+\u2009ABC were treated (group A, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200918; group B, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200921; group C, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096). Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of the partner drugs. Imlunestrant PK was consistent with previously reported data. For groups A, B, and C, the objective response rates (ORRs) were 7%, 25%, and 33%, respectively, while the clinical benefit rates (CBRs) were 44%, 48%, and 100%. In group C, the duration of response ranged between 5.13 and 9.46 months. In groups A and B, baseline plasma ctDNA sample sequencing identified prevalent alterations in <i>ERBB2</i> amplification (57%), <i>CCND1</i> amplification (22%), and mutations in <i>TP53</i> (49%), <i>PIK3CA</i> (30%), <i>ESR1</i> (24%), and <i>GATA3</i> (14%). Imlunestrant in combination with trastuzumab\u2009\u00b1\u2009abemaciclib or pertuzumab presented a safety profile that was consistent with those of the partnered drugs.

    "abstract": "Adding the pan-Akt serine/threonine kinase (AKT) inhibitor capivasertib to first-line paclitaxel in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) led to significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus placebo-paclitaxel in the phase II PAKT trial. CAPItello-290 was designed to further assess capivasertib-paclitaxel, including in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumours. Patients with previously untreated metastatic TNBC were randomised 1 : 1 to paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [day 1, weeks 1-3 (4-week cycle)] plus capivasertib 400 mg or placebo twice daily (days 2-5, weeks 1-3). PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations were analysed by retrospective central molecular testing. Dual primary endpoints were OS in the overall population and in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumours; investigator-assessed PFS was a key secondary endpoint. From July 2019 to February 2022, 812 patients were randomised; 30.7% of patients had PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN tumour alterations. At final analysis [data cut-off (DCO) 18 March 2024], the median OS for the overall population was 17.7 and 18.0 months with capivasertib-paclitaxel and placebo-paclitaxel, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.08, P = 0.3239] and for patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumours, it was 20.4 months in both arms (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77-1.43, P = 0.7602). At PFS DCO (25 May 2022), the median PFS in the overall population numerically favoured capivasertib-paclitaxel (5.6 versus 5.1 months placebo-paclitaxel; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84); this was also the case in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumours (7.5 versus 5.6 months placebo-paclitaxel; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95). The most frequent adverse event (AE) of grade \u22653 was diarrhoea [12.7% versus 0.7% placebo-paclitaxel (overall population)]. Capivasertib was discontinued due to AEs in 8.5% of patients (4.9% placebo-paclitaxel; overall population); AEs led to death in 4.2% of all patients. Capivasertib-paclitaxel did not meet the prespecified boundary for improving OS in either population; PFS numerically favoured the combination, especially in PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumours. The safety of capivasertib-paclitaxel was generally manageable and consistent with prior studies.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is hyperactivated in ~70% of breast cancers via mutations in oncogenes including PIK3CA or inactivation/depletion of phosphoinositide (PI)-phosphatases. Generation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by PI3K activates many downstream effectors, including AKT, that induce cellular proliferation in breast cancer. In this context PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is tightly regulated by PI-phosphatases, including the tumor suppressor PTEN and inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases such as PIPP/INPP5J. PTEN and PIPP dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to form different lipid products, thereby individually regulating AKT activation. PI3K/AKT signaling is complex and the functional interplay between these PI-phosphatases in suppressing this pathway in vivo is unknown. Here, we utilize experimental models of breast cancer, both dependent and independent of PIK3CA mutation. Pipp ablation in Pten<sup>+/-</sup> mice increases mammary AKT signaling and cell proliferation, associated with increased hyperplasia and ductal thickening, characteristics linked with mammary epithelial cell transformation. In breast cancer cell lines, combined PIPP/PTEN knockdown increases AKT signaling and cell proliferation, independent of mutant PIK3CA, above any single PI-phosphatase knockdown. Notably, combined PIPP/PTEN loss is observed in a subset of human breast cancers, associated with reduced survival. Collectively, these findings support a model whereby loss of PIPP constitutes a co-operative step towards breast cancer progression in the context of PTEN deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Combined CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy (ET) improves outcomes in advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer, but emergence of resistance to this combination underscores the pressing need for alternative therapeutic strategies. A promising approach involves adding an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to the standard combined CDK4/6i and ET, but selecting the most effective inhibitors and their optimal combinations has proven to be challenging. Here, we compared the efficacy of various triple combinations using single- or dual-point PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines, cell line xenografts, patient-derived xenografts, and organoids resistant to CDK4/6i and ET and exhibiting <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>PTEN</i>, or <i>AKT1</i> mutations. <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant, <i>PTEN</i>-wild type, CDK4/6i-resistant, and ET-resistant models required the addition of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor gedatolisib to effectively impede tumor growth by blocking the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway through both mTORC1 inhibition and PI3K/AKT-mediated modulation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 activity. Conversely, <i>PIK3CA</i>-wild type, <i>PTEN</i>-null cells benefited from triple combinations incorporating either the AKT inhibitor capivasertib or the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib to block tumor growth. In addition, gedatolisib reduced viability of <i>PIK3CA</i>- or <i>AKT1</i>-mutant and <i>PTEN</i>-wild type CDK4/6i-resistant patient-derived organoids compared with the \u03b1-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib.

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of bladder cancer initiation and progression. Translational research has identified mutations in chromatin-modifying genes such as KMT2D and KDM6A, which facilitate colonization of larger regions of the urothelium. Subsequent mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, FGFR3 or RB1 drive malignant transformation. Advances in personalized oncology now integrate clinical, pathological and molecular classifications in bladder cancer, representing a paradigm shift in the management of locally advanced and metastatic disease. Alterations in FGFR3, commonly found in the luminal-papillary molecular subtype associated with low response to immunotherapy, are the target of erdafitinib. Enfortumab vedotin, which targets Nectin-4 (expressed in >95% of urothelial carcinomas), is approved for patients who progress after chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Evidence suggests that Nectin-4 gene amplification may further refine patient stratification. Sacituzumab govitecan, an antibody-drug conjugate directed against Trop-2, is effective in basal, luminal and stroma-rich subtypes but not in neuroendocrine carcinomas. In addition, therapies developed for HER2-positive breast cancer have shown efficacy in urothelial carcinoma, with recent data from the DESTINY pan-tumour phase II trial leading to FDA approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-overexpressing metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This paper is a comprehensive review of the molecular pathology of bladder cancer, highlighting advances in molecular classification, biomarkers and personalized therapies.

Early recurrence is a major challenge in luminal HER2-negative high proliferative breast cancer, yet reliable biomarkers remain limited. Identifying biomarkers associated with early recurrence is therefore of significant interest. Forty-two patients with stage I-III luminal HER2-negative, high-proliferative breast cancer were enrolled in the VGHTPE cohort and underwent targeted next-generation sequencing using the ACTOnco Comprehensive Cancer Panel. Findings were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and METABRIC datasets, and in vitro experiments were conducted to assess cell aggressiveness. We examined 42 patients, including 15 who experienced recurrence within five years and 27 who did not. Next-generation sequencing revealed that the most prevalent alterations in this luminal HER2-negative, high-proliferative breast cancer cohort were mutations in PIK3CA and TP53, and amplifications/gains in MCL1, MYC, and KLF6. Patients with recurrence within five years exhibited a higher frequency of ITGB2 gain compared with non-recurrent patients. Validation in the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts confirmed the prognostic significance of ITGB2 gain in ER+/HER2- breast cancers. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated that high ITGB2 expression was enriched in KRAS and EMT pathways. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that ITGB2 knockdown led to inactivation of Akt and ERK signaling and suppression of cell aggressiveness in ER+/HER2- breast cancer cells. ITGB2 gain represents an unfavorable prognostic marker for early recurrence in luminal HER2-negative high proliferative breast cancer, with potential therapeutic implications.",

Data from 58 IBC patients with metastatic HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- IBC from a single institution were reviewed. The medians (95% confidence intervals) of overall survival (OS), PFS, and time on treatment (ToT) from the time of CDKI initiation were reported via the Kaplan\u2012Meier method. Differences were tested by the log-rank test. We identified 58 patients (including 16 with de novo stage IV disease). The median OS, PFS, and ToT in the total cohort were 26 (16, 37), 7 (5, 10), and 7 (5, 10) months (mos), respectively. No differences were observed between pre-menopausal patients and postmenopausal patients. The OS, PFS, and ToT rates at the initial diagnosis of Stage III later developing metastatic breast cancer (MBC, N\u2009=\u200942) and de novo IV (N\u2009=\u200916) patients were 19 (15, 34) vs 34 (21, NR), 7 (5, 14) vs 9 (6, NR), and 6 (5, 10) vs 9 (4, NR) mos, respectively (ns).

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge because of limitations in early detection and therapeutic outcomes. This study employed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate SUMOylation-associated molecular networks, aiming to identify prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic applications. Transcriptomic profiling was performed on 1,445 breast cancer and 113 normal samples to identify differentially expressed genes. Four hub genes, <i>NR3C2</i>, <i>CDCA8</i>, <i>AURKA</i>, and <i>PLK1</i>, were prioritized using machine learning. Consensus clustering stratified patients into molecular subtypes based on the hub gene expression patterns. Differential immune infiltration analysis was used to evaluate 28 immune cell populations between the subtypes. Hub gene-immune cell interactions were visualized using bubble diagrams. Pharmacogenomic sensitivity profiling was performed using subtype-specific drug response data. Single-cell sequencing identified epithelial subclusters enriched for hub genes, and transcription factor networks were analyzed using SCENIC. Pan-cancer validation was performed to assess the oncogenic role of hub genes in 21 malignancies. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's <i>t</i>-test (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Tumor tissues exhibited significant upregulation of <i>CDCA8</i>, <i>AURKA</i>, and <i>PLK1</i>, whereas <i>NR3C2</i> was notably downregulated (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Consensus clustering identified two distinct molecular subtypes: Subtype1, characterized by <i>NR3C2</i> upregulation and poorer prognosis, and Subtype2, distinguished by enhanced expression of <i>CDCA8</i>, <i>AURKA</i>, and <i>PLK1</i>, correlating with favorable outcomes. Notably, PIK3CA mutations were prevalent in Subtype1, whereas <i>TP53</i> mutations dominated Subtype2. Immune infiltration profiles differed significantly between the two subtypes for most immune cell types. Pharmacogenomic assessments revealed distinct drug sensitivity profiles for each subtype in response to various therapeutic agents. A pan-cancer analysis of the four hub genes demonstrated consistent expression patterns, immune correlations, and prognostic associations across malignancies. Our findings reveal that SUMOylation subtypes in breast cancer exhibit distinct prognostic, immunological and pharmacogenomic profiles. These insights may provide candidate biomarkers for future personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer and potentially for other malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy in women, with patient outcomes heavily influenced by complex molecular mechanisms like programmed cell death (PCD) and RNA methylation. While some studies have investigated how specific PCD types and N6-methyladenosine-related genes (m6A-RGs) are associated with breast cancer, the research on combined PCD mechanisms and their role in breast cancer development is limited. This study integrates PCD-related genes (PCD-RGs) and m6A-RGs to offer new insights for breast cancer clinical treatment. Transcriptomic data and related genes were respectively retrieved from public databases and published literature. First, PCD-m6A genes identified through the correlation scoring and differentially expressed genes were intersected to obtain candidate genes. Furthermore, to infer potential causal relationships between gene expression and survival, we applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach using summary-level data from public databases. Therefore, prognostic genes were further obtained through Mendelian randomization and regression analyses, and a prognostic model was then constructed. Additionally, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity analyses were conducted. Finally, the expression intensity of prognostic genes was verified by RT-qPCR and IHC. Through a series of analyses, seven prognostic genes were identified. Following this, the prognostic model has been demonstrated to have a certain degree of accuracy as indicated by both transcriptomic public sets. Successively, enrichment analysis revealed numerous pathways, among which herpes simplex virus 1 infection was notable; its relevance lies in overlapping immune evasion pathways with BC, a core focus of our investigation. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that 11 immune cell types, including M1 macrophages, exhibited significant differences between high and low groups. A key finding from drug sensitivity analysis was that the high-risk group exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to several drugs, including CCT018159, rapamycin, vinblastine, metformin, and roscovitine. The expression levels of MYD88, DAXX and ANXA5 were significantly upregulated in the control samples compared to breast cancer samples. Moreover, the expression levels of SESN3, CRIP1, DPP4 and PIK3CA were significantly upregulated in breast cancer samples compared to control samples.

Baseline detection was higher in grade 3 tumors, lower in multifocal/multicentric disease, and higher in residual cancer burden (RCB) 3. MYC gains/amplifications were enriched in ultrasound (US) responders, while PIK3CA gains were enriched in US non-responders; FAT1 losses were enriched in RCB 3. Baseline ctDNA predicted poor response to this regimen, supporting ctDNA as a biomarker to guide treatment in HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2-negative disease.

    "title": "Metformin enhances alpelisib sensitivity in HER2+ breast cancer by suppressing cancer stemness and oncogenic signaling.",
    "abstract": "Alpelisib, a selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor that targets PIK3CA mutations, is approved for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. However, its therapeutic potential in HER2-positive disease remains underexplored. Hyperglycemia, a frequent adverse event of alpelisib, limits its clinical application. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug with reported anticancer activity, may counteract alpelisib-induced hyperglycemia while enhancing its antitumor efficacy. We evaluated the effects of alpelisib alone and in combination with metformin in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and BT-474. Cell viability, colony formation, and tumorsphere assays were performed to assess proliferation and stemness. Flow cytometry was used to analyze ALDH1-positive cell populations and cell-cycle distribution. Synergy was determined using the combination index method. Western blotting examined the effects on signaling pathways and stemness-associated proteins. Alpelisib monotherapy inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and cancer stem cell features in both cell lines. Metformin enhanced these effects, demonstrating strong synergism. Combination treatment induced significant G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, reduced ALDH1\u207a populations, and decreased tumorsphere formation. Mechanistically, co-treatment broadly suppressed receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling, augmenting inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT pathways, along with downregulation of c-Myc. Stemness-related proteins including \u03b2-catenin, Nanog, Sox2, KLF4, and LGR5 were also markedly reduced. These findings indicate that metformin synergistically enhances the antitumor activity of alpelisib in HER2-positive breast cancer by inhibiting oncogenic signaling and stemness pathways. Beyond its metabolic benefit in mitigating hyperglycemia, metformin may potentiate PI3K-targeted therapies, supporting further preclinical and clinical evaluation of this combination strategy.",

    "title": "Integrated theoretical and experimental analysis of 4-amino-N-methylphthalimide: structural, spectroscopic, and anti-breast cancer potential.",
    "abstract": "The structure of 4-Amino-N-methylphthalimide (4AMP) was investigated through spectroscopic techniques and quantum chemical calculations. Structural parameters were optimized using the DFT-B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method in both gas and DMSO phases. Experimental results from powder XRD and reported single crystal XRD showed excellent agreement. The experimental FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra correlated well with theoretical vibrational frequencies, and UV-Vis spectra comparisons further validated the computational findings. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), Mulliken and natural charges, and Fukui function analyses highlighted the reactive regions of 4AMP. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed stabilization energies of bonding and antibonding orbitals. Hirshfeld surface and fingerprint analyses provided insights into intra and intermolecular interactions. Biological studies indicated that 4AMP exhibited the strongest binding affinity towards the PI3K\u03b1 (PIK3CA catalytic subunit) at -6.9\u2009kcal/mol, suggesting significant therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns have been performed to assess the stability and dynamic behaviour of 4AMP. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated potent activity against breast cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>5</sub><sub>0</sub> values of 16.89\u2009\u03bcg/mL (MCF-7) and 19.53\u2009\u03bcg/mL (MDA-MB-231). These findings suggest that 4AMP possesses promising anticancer activity, combining favourable structural, spectroscopic, and biological characteristics, making it a potential candidate for targeted breast cancer therapy.",

    "title": "Paired-Sample and Pathway-Anchored MLOps Framework for Robust Transcriptomic Machine Learning in Small Cohorts: Model Classification Study.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 90% of the 65,000 human diseases are infrequent, collectively affecting ~400 million people, substantially limiting cohort accrual. This low prevalence constrains the development of robust transcriptome-based machine learning (ML) classifiers. Standard data-driven classifiers typically require cohorts of more than 100 participants per group to achieve clinical accuracy while managing high-dimensional input (~25,000 transcripts). These requirements are infeasible for microcohorts of ~20 individuals, where overfitting becomes pervasive. To overcome these constraints, we developed a classification method that integrates three enabling strategies: (i) paired-sample transcriptome dynamics, (ii) N-of-1 pathway-based analytics, and (iii) reproducible machine learning operations (MLOps) for continuous model refinement. Unlike ML approaches relying on a single transcriptome per subject, within-subject paired-sample designs-such as pre- versus post-treatment or diseased versus adjacent-normal tissue-effectively control intraindividual variability under isogenic conditions and within-subject environmental exposures (eg, smoking history, other medications, etc), improve signal-to-noise ratios, and, when pre-processed as single- studies (N-of-1), can achieve statistical power comparable with that obtained in animal models. Pathway-level N-of-1 analytics further reduces each sample's high-dimensional profile into ~4000 biologically interpretable features, annotated with effect sizes, dispersion, and significance. Complementary MLOp practices-automated versioning, continuous monitoring, and adaptive hyperparameter tuning-improve model reproducibility and generalization. In two case studies of distinct diseases, human rhinovirus infection (HRV) versus matched healthy controls (n=16 training; n=3 test) and breast cancer tissues harboring TP53 or PIK3CA mutations versus adjacent normal tissue (n=27 training; n=9 test)-this approach achieved 90% precision and recall on an unseen breast cancer test set and 92% precision with 90% recall in rhinovirus fivefold cross-validation. Incorporating paired-sample dynamics boosted precision by up to 12% and recall by 13% in breast cancer and by 5% each in HRV. MLOps workflows yielded an additional ~14.5% accuracy improvement compared to traditional pipelines. Moreover, our method identified 42 critical gene sets (pathways) for rhinovirus response and 21 for breast cancer mutation status, selected as the most important features (mean decrease impurity) of the best-performing model, with retroactive ablation of top 20 features reducing accuracy by ~25%. These proof-of-concept results support the utility of integrating intrasubject dynamics, \"biological knowledge\"-based feature reduction (pathway-level feature reduction grounded in prior biological knowledge; eg, N-of-1-pathway analytics), and reproducible MLOp workflows can overcome cohort size limitations in infrequent disease, offering a scalable, interpretable solution for high-dimensional transcriptomic classification. Future work will extend these advances across various therapeutic and small cohort designs.",

    "title": "Whole-exome sequencing for identification of specific gene mutations in an Indian cohort of triple-negative breast cancer patients.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are the most aggressive, heterogeneous subtype of breast carcinoma with increased chemoradioresistance and a high rate of relapse. A compelling need exists to discover specific gene mutation(s) and the exomic mutational landscape associated with Indian TNBC patients to identify potential therapeutic target(s) for effective treatment of TNBC. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 15 TNBC patients along with 5 random adjacent normal control tissue (ANCT) specimens. WES data alignment and mapping to the reference human genome (hg19) were done using BWA, SAMtools, and Picard tools. The data analysis and mutation calling were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. The <i>Signal Analyze</i> and PANTHER pathways tools were utilized for mutational signature(s) and pathway(s) analysis, respectively. Our data revealed that the TNBC genomes carried an average of ~\u2009106 mutations per sample. MutSig2CV analysis showed the most significant recurrent somatic mutations in <i>CTNNB1</i> (47%; 7/15), <i>TP53</i> (33%; 5/15), <i>SLC7A8</i> (27%; 4/15), <i>AMOT</i> (20%; 3/15), <i>CLEC11A</i> (20%; 3/15), and <i>ECHDC1</i> (13%; 2/15) with a q value of \u2264\u20090.1. We also observed somatic recurrent mutations in other important cancer-associated genes such as <i>ABCC3</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>BIRC6</i>, <i>CDH7</i>, <i>CSMD3</i>, <i>MUC12</i>, <i>MUC16</i>, <i>NT5C1B</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>POLE</i>, <i>STK31</i>, <i>TTN</i>, and <i>ZFHX4</i>. Moreover, we have noticed germline mutations in <i>TP53</i>, <i>BIN1</i>, <i>MLH1</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, and <i>GPSM2</i>. Interestingly, the TNBC genomes exhibited a predominance of signature 1, which is associated with spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine; signature 3 represented the failure of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination; and signature 5 correlated with transcriptional strand bias. Interestingly, the high tumor mutational burden was observed specifically in TNBC patients with signature 3. Furthermore, these mutations were involved in several major signaling pathways, including the Wnt, p53, PDGF, cadherin, DNA replication, integrin, and apoptosis signaling pathways. Together, the findings indicated that the crucial role played by these key genetic mutations could be utilized in screening and developing potential targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and feasibility of ipatasertib combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as maintenance therapy after first-line treatment in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer harboring PIK3CA mutations (PIK3CAmut). This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase 1b study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor, combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HP), with or without endocrine therapy as maintainance therapy, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CAmut, HER2-positive breast cancer following first-line induction chemotherapy and HP. Seventeen patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 27.7 months. During the dose selection phase, ipatasertib at 400 mg daily (21 days on, 7 days off) with standard HP was established as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This decision was based on the absence of dose-limiting toxicities in the first six patients treated at this dose during the initial 28-day cycle, which constituted the primary endpoint. Seven (41.2%) patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), with diarrhea and nausea being the most frequent. Two (11.8%) reported four serious TRAEs (diarrhea, vomiting, ischemic stroke, and pneumonitis, one case each) related to ipatasertib, from which they recovered. Confirmed overall response rate was 31.1% (95% CI: 12.1-58.5%), clinical benefit rate 84.6% (95% CI: 53.7-97.3%), and median progression-free survival 16.4 months (95% CI: 9.4-NR), with 47.3% of patients being progression-free at 18 months. These results support ipatasertib plus HP as a safe and promising maintenance strategy for HER2-positive breast tumors harboring PIK3CAmut. gov registration: NCT04253561.",
